Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes.

Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n"

You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes.

Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n"

Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

                                "content": "\nTeam Master Brief — Java Snake (STRICT 3-file repository)\n\n== GLOBAL HARD RULES (all roles must comply) ==\n\n1. Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Goal: Build a tiny Java Swing “Snake” game.\n2. Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",

Language: Java 11 only.\n3. Build tool: Maven only.\n4. Package name: correct\n5. Java 11 **syntax only**. Do **NOT** use features introduced **after** Java 11:\n   - No switch **expressions** (`case ->`, `yield`).\n   - No text blocks (`\"\"\"`), no records (`record`), no sealed classes (`sealed`/`permits`),\n     no pattern matching for `instanceof`, no preview features or flags.\n   - Prefer **explicit types** (avoid `var` in public APIs); code must compile with `-source 11 -target 11`\n     **without** `--enable-preview`.\n\nFinal repository MUST contain EXACTLY these three files (no more, no less, exact paths):\n1. pom.xml\n2. src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\n3. src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\n\nWARN:\nAllowed paths WHITELIST (no exceptions): {\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"}.\nAny other path or file is FORBIDDEN (e.g., \"src/main/java/com/project/*\", extra classes like \"Point.java\", additional resources, or alternative packages).\nThe only valid package directory is \"correct\" (NOT \"com/project\" or any other).\n\nSingle-file app logic: ALL gameplay and GUI logic (board, movement, food, collisions, growth, scoring, restart, render, loop) MUST live inside SnakeGame.java. You may use inner/non-public helper classes in the SAME file. SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible.

SnakeGame MUST include a public static void main(String[] args).\n\nTests: SnakeGameTest.java contains all tests (can be minimal) and ALSO has a main method to run tests directly.\n\nRun command (MUST launch a GUI successfully):\nmvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n\nNO extra files/folders (no README, resources, configs, scripts, notebooks, etc.). If more helpers seem necessary, embed them as inner classes inside SnakeGame.java.\n\nUI: Swing (JFrame + JPanel). Arrow keys control. Score visible. “Game Over” dialog with restart.\nCode: clean, readable, no TODOs/dead code, minimal but sufficient comments.\n\n== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (complete & aligned with your list) ==\n• Game Board:\n    Create a grid-based game board.\n    Define grid dimensions (e.g., 20×20).\n    Display the grid on screen via Swing painting.\n• Snake Initialization:\n    Place the snake on the board.\n    Define initial length and starting position.\n    Choose an initial direction (e.g., right).\n• Snake Movement:\n    Implement arrow-key controls.\n    Ensure continuous movement on a fixed tick.\n    Update the snake’s position each tick.\n• Food Generation:\n    Generate food at random grid cells.\n    Ensure food never appears on the snake body.\n• Collision Handling:\n    Detect wall (boundary) collisions.\n    Detect self-collisions (head with body).\n    Detect head-on-food collisions.\n• Snake Growth:\n    Grow when eating food.\n    Append a new segment at the tail.\n• Score Display:\n    Maintain a score counter.\n    Display current score on screen.\n• Game Over Condition:\n    Game over on wall or self collision.\n    Show a “Game Over” message/dialog.\n    Allow restart WITHOUT quitting the app (reset state cleanly).\n• Graphics & UI:\n    Use Swing graphics to render snake and food (no external assets).\n    Provide clear instructions and score display.\n• Animations & Effects:\n    Use javax.swing.Timer (or equivalent) for a smooth tick/animation.\n    Provide basic visual feedback for collisions and eating (simple, not flashy).\n\n== PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) — Output: concise PRD (plain text) ==\n\nDeliver a short PRD with:\n\n1. Goal & user story (1–2 sentences).\n2. Acceptance criteria (checklist the runner can verify):\n3. The run command starts a window: mvn -q -DskipTests exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=correct.SnakeGame\n4. Arrow keys move the snake; eating food grows length and increases score.\n5. Hitting wall/self pops “Game Over” AND restart works without exiting.\n6. Package is correct; builds with **Java 11** (no preview flags); repository contains **EXACTLY** the 3 files. \n7. **Java 11 syntax compliance:** code contains **no** `case ->`/`yield`, `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n8. Non-goals (e.g., networking, assets/sound, advanced levels, high-end effects). \n9. Deliverables (restate the exact three paths).\n(Keep PRD short; do NOT expand scope; restate the “3-file only” rule.)\n\n== ARCHITECT — Output: one-page system design (plain text) ==\n\nProvide at most one page describing:\n1. Class layout INSIDE SnakeGame.java: one public class SnakeGame plus non-public helpers (inner or package-private) such as BoardPanel, Snake, Food, Direction enum, etc. ALL inside the same file.\n2. Event & loop: javax.swing.Timer tick (e.g., 100 ms), key listeners, repaint pipeline.\n3. Data model: snake body list, direction enum, grid size (e.g., 20×20), cell size, score counter.\n4. Collision rules & restart flow (state reset).\n5. Testing seam: how SnakeGameTest.java (also with main) performs minimal checks (headless or simple assertions).\n6. Confirm **Java 11-only syntax** and package `correct`. No additional source files.\n7. **Explicitly require classic `switch` statements** (`case:` + `break`) for direction updates; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`.\nOptional: tiny ASCII structure/sequence diagram.\n\n== PROJECT MANAGER (PMgr) — Output: STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose) ==\nOutput exactly ONE JSON object with these keys (no extras, same order):\n\n{\n    \"Required packages\": [],\n    \"Logic Analysis\": [\n        [\"pom.xml\", \"Maven compiler plugin (source/target/release=11), Enforcer requires Java 11, exec-maven-plugin runs correct.SnakeGame; **no preview flags**\"],\n        [\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\", \"All game logic + GUI + main()\"],\n        [\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\", \"Minimal tests + main()\"]\n    ],\n    \"Task list\": [\n        \"pom.xml\",\n        \"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\n        \"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"\n    ],\n    \"Full API spec\": \"\",\n    \"Shared Knowledge\": \"All helper types live inside SnakeGame.java as inner or package-private classes. No extra files. **Java 11-only syntax**: use classic switch (no '->'/'yield'); no text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching; no preview flags.\",\n    \"Anything UNCLEAR\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n\n1. Task list MUST contain exactly the three paths above in that order.\n2. Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.\n3. STRICT VALIDATION for PMgr:\n    - The \"Task list\" value MUST be EXACTLY the following array (string-equal, same order, same casing):\n    [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]\n    - Do NOT introduce any additional items (e.g., \"Point.java\") or alternate directories (e.g., \"com/project\").\n    - If upstream planning suggests extra files, OMIT them and keep the exact 3-file list.\n\n== ENGINEER — Implementation constraints (for context) ==\n\n1. Generate ONLY the three files; SnakeGame.java contains everything and has main; SnakeGameTest.java has minimal tests with main.\n2. Swing only; Maven pom.xml sets **Java 11** (maven-compiler-plugin with `<source>11</source><target>11</target><release>11</release>`), Enforcer requires Java 11; **no** `--enable-preview`. Use exec-maven-plugin to run `correct.SnakeGame`. \n3. After generation, the run command must succeed and show the GUI.\n4. If helpers are needed, embed them INSIDE SnakeGame.java as inner/package-private classes; do NOT create new files.\n5. **Use classic `switch` statements** for direction/logic; **do not** use switch expressions (`case ->`) or `yield`. Avoid text blocks/records/sealed/pattern-matching. Prefer explicit types over `var`.\n\n== COMPLIANCE GATES (self-check before output) ==\n\n1. Repository contains EXACTLY the three files: pom.xml, src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java, src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java.\n2. Package name is correct.\n3. Maven + **Java 11** build passes; run command launches the GUI; build uses no preview flags. \n4. No extra modules/folders/resources/scripts/READMEs/notebooks.\n5. All functional items are satisfied: grid board, init, movement, random food (non-overlapping), collisions (wall/self/food), growth, scoring, Game Over + restart, Swing rendering, timer animation, basic visual feedback. \n6. **Java 11 syntax compliance check** (must be true):\n   - Source contains **no** `case ->` or `yield` in `switch`.\n   - Source contains **no** `\"\"\"`, `record`, `sealed`, `permits`, or pattern-matching `instanceof`.\n   - Compiles with `-source 11 -target 11` **without** `--enable-preview`.\n7. PMgr JSON compliance: \"Task list\" EXACTLY equals [\"pom.xml\",\"src/main/java/correct/SnakeGame.java\",\"src/test/java/correct/SnakeGameTest.java\"]; any deviation is INVALID and must be corrected before handing off to Engineer. \n\n== NOTES TO ROLES ==\n\n1. If anyone believes a fourth file is needed, DO NOT add it—fold helpers into SnakeGame.java.\n2. Keep outputs minimal and executable; avoid verbose documents.\n3. Never change the package or directories to \"com.project\" (or similar). Always use package \"correct\" and the exact paths above.\n4. Treat any suggestion to use **Java 12+** features as out-of-scope; keep everything Java 11-compatible. '''\n",
