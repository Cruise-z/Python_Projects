{"Implementation approach":"We will develop a simple and engaging Snake game using Java Swing, adhering to Java 11 features and Maven build system. The game will be contained within a strict 3-file repository structure, including a single Java file for the game logic, a Maven configuration file, and a test file. We will utilize basic Java Swing components for the UI and handle game logic such as movement, collision detection, and score management within the same Java file.","File list":["SnakeGame.java","pom.xml","SnakeGameTest.java"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class SnakeGame {\n        -JFrame frame\n        -JPanel board\n        -ArrayList<Point> snake\n        -Point food\n        -int score\n        -boolean running\n        +main(String[] args): void\n        +initializeGame(): void\n        +startGame(): void\n        +move(): void\n        +checkCollision(): void\n        +updateScore(): void\n        +restartGame(): void\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant SG as SnakeGame\n    SG->>SG: main(args)\n    SG->>SG: initializeGame()\n    SG->>SG: startGame()\n    loop Game Loop\n        SG->>SG: move()\n        SG->>SG: checkCollision()\n        SG->>SG: updateScore()\n    end\n    SG->>SG: restartGame()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on specific Java Swing components to be used for optimal performance and responsiveness."}
