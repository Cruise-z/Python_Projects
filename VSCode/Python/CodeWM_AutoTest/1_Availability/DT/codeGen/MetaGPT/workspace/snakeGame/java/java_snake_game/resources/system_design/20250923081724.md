## Implementation approach

We will develop a simple and engaging Snake game using Java Swing, adhering to Java 11 features and Maven build system. The game will be contained within a strict 3-file repository structure, including a single Java file for the game logic, a Maven configuration file, and a test file. We will utilize basic Java Swing components for the UI and handle game logic such as movement, collision detection, and score management within the same Java file.

## File list

- SnakeGame.java
- pom.xml
- SnakeGameTest.java

## Data structures and interfaces

    class SnakeGame {
        -JFrame frame
        -JPanel board
        -ArrayList<Point> snake
        -Point food
        -int score
        -boolean running
        +main(String[] args): void
        +initializeGame(): void
        +startGame(): void
        +move(): void
        +checkCollision(): void
        +updateScore(): void
        +restartGame(): void
    }


## Program call flow

    SG->>SG: initializeGame()
    SG->>SG: startGame()
    loop Game Loop
        SG->>SG: move()
        SG->>SG: checkCollision()
        SG->>SG: updateScore()
    end
    SG->>SG: restartGame()


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific Java Swing components to be used for optimal performance and responsiveness.
