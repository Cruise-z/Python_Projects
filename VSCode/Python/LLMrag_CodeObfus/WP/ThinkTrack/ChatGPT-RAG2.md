Randomized repositioning of variable declarations strictly within their lexical scope. For each variable, the declaration must appear before its initialization in the control flow. This process preserves semantic correctness while disrupting variable lifecycle locality.
</obfus_desc>

<content> 
This obfuscation type targets **Named Local Variable Declarations** within a function or block scope. 
When working with variables, you can declare and initialize them in one go(e.g., int x = 5;), or split the process into two steps — first declare, then initialize(int x; and x = 5;). 
For each variable:

- If a declaration and initialization appear in a single statement (e.g., int x = 5;), the transformation will split this into two separate statements (int x; and x = 5;).
- Declaration will then be randomly relocated, as long as:
  1. The declaration appears **before** the initialization.
  2. All movements remain within the original lexical scope.

The transformation must preserve:

- Variable names, types, modifiers (e.g., annotations).
- The control-flow behavior and semantic correctness of the program.
- The original position of the **initialization**.

This form of obfuscation is designed to confuse static analyzers and models by breaking common assumptions about variable lifecycle locality.

<operation>:
Then do *Randomized repositioning of variable declarations strictly within their lexical scope. For each variable, the declaration must appear before its initialization in the control flow. This process preserves semantic correctness while disrupting variable lifecycle locality.*
[constraints] 
The transformation is governed by the following constraints:

- This transformation applies to the **declaration position** of each variable.
- **Declaration** must remain strictly **within the lexical scope** in which the variable was originally declared (e.g., inside a try, if, or loop block).
- The **declaration must appear before the initialization** in the control flow.
- If a variable is declared and initialized together (e.g., int i = 0;), they may be **split** into separate statements (e.g., int i; i = 0;).
- Variable names, types, modifiers, the initialization value **must all remain unchanged**：
  - Variable **declaration and initialization** may be split, but must **remain in order**: declaration → initialization.
  - No renaming, inlining, merging, hoisting, or deletion is allowed.
  - All transformations must be performed **within the variable’s declared lexical scope** only (e.g., loop body, method block).

[typical_changes] 
Typical changes include:

- Splitting declaration + initialization into separate lines (e.g., transforming int i = 0; into int i; i = 0;).
- Splitting or merging declarations of multiple variables of the same type (e.g., int i, j; vs. int i; int j;), provided their scope and usage order remain valid.
- Relocating local variable declarations randomly between **the beginning of its lexical scope** and **its initialization position**, while ensuring that **declarations precede initializations**.
- Ensuring that each variable's name, type, modifiers, the initialization value remain unchanged, so the semantic behavior of the program is fully preserved.

[algorithm] 

1. Find all local variables from the data stream **Entity information** extracted by Tool.
2. For each local variable:
   - Identify the usage_context field and the DeclPos_rearrangeable_gaps field. The DeclPos_rearrangeable_gaps defines legal code intervals about the declaration of the variable where they can be safely repositioned, provided it's declaration appears before the variable’s initialization and within its lexical scope.
   - In usage_context:
     - if the declaration and initialization are in the same line:
       - Split declaration and initialization into two statements
     - if the declaration and initialization are separated:
       - (Optional) Merge declaration and initialization into a single statement.
   - Randomly position the declaration based on the DeclPos_rearrangeable_gaps field, ensuring:
     - if the declaration and initialization are splited:
       - declaration must appear before initialization
       - declaration can go anywhere but must be rearranged **between these DeclInitPos_rearrangeable_gaps**  
     - if the declaration and initialization are merged:
       - The merged declaration and initialization must be positioned at the original initialization location.
         Ensure initialization line is **untouched** and still receives the previous value!
         **FALLBACK: If a variable cannot be legally transformed (e.g., used in a lambda, or control-flow-sensitive position), skip its transformation and leave it unchanged.

✅ 第二部分：强执行型 Prompt 模板（Zero-Flex 指令）
-----------------------------------

使用此 Prompt 模板可确保大模型严格按上述结构执行：

````plaintext
You are a code transformation engine. Given Java source code and a list of local variables with their declaration and initialization metadata, you must apply the "Lexical Declaration Reordering" transformation.

### Transformation Rules:

1. If a variable is declared and initialized on the same line (e.g., `int x = 1;`), split it into:
   - Declaration: `int x;`
   - Initialization: `x = 1;`

2. Relocate the declaration line into any of the specified `rearrangeable_gaps`, making sure:
   - The declaration occurs **before** the initialization line in the control flow.
   - You **do not modify** the initialization line.
   - Keep the relocation **within the same method scope**.

3. Preserve all variable names, types, modifiers, and initialization logic. Do not merge, rename, delete, or move initialization code.

---

### Your Input:
```json
{ ...粘贴上面的 JSON RAG 数据... }
````

* * *

### Your Task:

Return the **fully transformed and obfuscated Java source code** with relocated variable declarations according to the instructions.

⚠️ Output a single Java code block only. Do not explain, summarize, or list changes.

```

---

## ✅ 可选强化内容（如需）：

### 可添加的扩展字段：

| 字段 | 用途 |
|------|------|
| `"skipped_entities"` | 记录无法变换的变量及原因（如 lambda 内变量） |
| `"transformation_id"` | 标识此次变换任务，便于回溯 |
| `"rationale"` | 给模型使用的策略说明，可以保留但不出现在最终输出 |

---

## ✅ 下一步你可选择：

1. 让我帮你将某一段 Java 代码转成上述 JSON 结构？
2. 将该结构送入大模型进行 Obfuscation 测试？
3. 需要我写一段脚本自动分析 Java AST → 提取变量结构？

你希望我帮你处理哪一部分？我可以立即开始。

   - In usage_context:
     - if the declaration and initialization are in the same line:
       - Split declaration and initialization into two statements
     - if the declaration and initialization are separated:
       - (Optional) Merge declaration and initialization into a single statement.
   - Randomly position the declaration based on the DeclPos_rearrangeable_gaps field, ensuring:
     - if the declaration and initialization are splited:
       - declaration must appear before initialization
       - declaration can go anywhere but must be rearranged **between these DeclInitPos_rearrangeable_gaps**  
     - if the declaration and initialization are merged:
       - The merged declaration and initialization must be positioned at the original initialization location.
         Ensure initialization line is **untouched** and still receives the previous value!
         **FALLBACK: If a variable cannot be legally transformed (e.g., used in a lambda, or control-flow-sensitive position), skip its transformation and leave it unchanged.

### ✅ 格式说明：

| 字段 | 作用 |
| --- | --- |
| `original_code` / `obfuscated_code` | 分别表示混淆前和混淆后的代码（逐行字符串数组） |
| `variables` | 每个变量的原始/重排声明位置、是否需要拆分、变换类型等 |
| `diff` | 记录变量变换前后的行位置变动和策略解释 |
| `transformation_instructions` | 控制变换行为的规则集合 |

* * *

如你需要，我也可以：

*   ✅ 将多个这样的 RAG JSON 批量构建；
    
*   ✅ 设计一个 JSON-to-code 反向渲染器（将 JSON 变换结果还原为 `<tag>` 结构文本）；
    
*   ✅ 提供随机插入器模拟“扰乱性重排”而不触犯控制流。
    

需要我现在为你扩展其中哪一项？
