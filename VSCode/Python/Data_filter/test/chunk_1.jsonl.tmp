{"text": "Abbreviation for \"Windows NT LAN Manager\"\nThe NTLM protocol was the default for network authentication in the Windows NT 4.0 operating system. It is retained in Windows 2000 for compatibility with down-level clients and servers. NTLM is also used to authenticate logons to standalone computers with Windows 2000. Computers with Windows 3.11, Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0 will use the NTLM protocol for network authentication in Windows 2000 domains. Computers running Windows 2000 will use NTLM when authenticating to servers with Windows NT 4.0 and when accessing resources in Windows NT 4.0 domains.*\nNTLM uses a challenge-response mechanism for authentication, in which clients are able to prove their identities without sending a password to the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred to as Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication). The protocol continues to be supported in Windows 2000 but has been replaced by Microsoft Kerberos as the default/standard.\nFeatured Partners Sponsored\n- Increase worker productivity, enhance data security, and enjoy greater energy savings.

{"text": "Cybercriminals gangs are creating a surge in ransomware, says a new report from Symantec.\nRansomware is a type of malware best described as an online extortion racket. Malware locks or disables your PC in some way and then demands payment in the form of a \"fine\" to render your PC usable again. Like most scams, the ransomware message claims to come from a legitimate organization, such as the government or a public corporation, to try to convince victims that they did something wrong to incur the fine.\nBut paying the fine does nothing since the initial malware remains on the PC and must still be manually removed.\nThis scam has risen in popularity over the past several years, but 2012 witnessed an increase in both the number and variety of ransomware campaigns, Symantec said in its report. That growth is due largely to a upsurge in the number of worldwide criminal gangs using this scheme to make a buck.\n\"From just a few small groups experimenting with this fraud, several organized gangs are now taking this scheme to a professional level and the number of compromised computers has increased,\" the report noted. \"Symantec has identified at least 16 different versions of ransomware.\"\nOne malware investigation mentioned in the report discovered 68,000 affected computers in a single month. Another one caught a Trojan attempting to infect 500,000 PCs over the course of just 18 days.\nCriminals go where the money is, and ransomware can be a cash cow. As much as 2.9 percent of all people affected by ransomware end up paying the ransom, Symantec said. Criminal gangs have stolen more than $5 million a year from unsuspecting victims, according to one estimate, however, Symantec believes the dollar amount to be much higher.\nThough a variety of different gangs are active, many get their ransomware from the same source, the report said. A single individual, who remains unknown, seems to have a full-time job of developing ransomware to fill requests from the criminal gangs.\nOne of ransomware's weaknesses is that it's usually obvious, Symantec noted. Many users who receive such messages simply scan their PCs, which then removes the Trojan associated with the ransomware.\nBut as more users fail to fall for the scam, the criminal gangs may simply fine-tune their methods of attack.\n\"As awareness of these scams increases, the attackers and their malware are likely to evolve and use more sophisticated techniques to evade detection and prevent removal, the report said. \"The 'ransom letter' will likely also evolve and the attackers will use different hooks to defraud innocent users.\"", "label": 1}

You may believe that you've set up complicated passwords for each of your online accounts, but experts warn they probably are not complex enough to keep hackers at bay. Our Candace Hopkins has simple tips to keep your information secure.\nTo view our videos, you need to\ninstall Adobe Flash 9 or above. Install now.\nThen come back here and refresh the page.\nUNITED STATES -- Computers and smart phones have simplified every day activities like banking, shopping and communicating with friends. But when these functions moved online, users were forced to create dozens of accounts, each guarded with a password.\n\"You've got your email. I do web development, so there's servers and publishing software and things like that to log into, so there was a ton of different sites,\" said Syracuse University senior Andrew Bauer.\nBut experts say the average person can only remember about five passwords, meaning some get used for several different accounts.\n\"I try to switch them up, use similar names, but switching up the characters, using dollar signs or asterisks or capital letter here, lower case the next and switching it up,\" said Syracuse University junior Anthony Dann.\nThat's a common practice. But experts warn those variations are not enough. That's because most passwords can be hacked by computer programs in just minutes.\n\"Even combinations of like two dictionary words together is easily hackable, as is replacing a dictionary word with typical characters like you might replace an ‘a’ with an @ symbol or an ‘e’ with a ‘3.’ Those are things most hackers have caught on to and makes your password easy to break,\" said SU School of Information Studies Adjunct Professor Michael Fudge.\nThe best way he says to strengthen your password is by adding length to it, which can be done by placing a number sequence at the end. And if you can't remember such complicated passwords, there are websites called password database managers that can do that for you. You simply set up a master password and the program creates and stores passwords for all of your other log-ins.\n\"You don't have to remember any of the other passwords, when you go to a site login box, you tell the password manager to initiate a log-in for you. Many of the passwords I use on all my sites, I don't even know them, I know they're long and complicated and hard to guess and different from all the other sites,\" said Fudge.\nAnd experts say don't worry, those password database managers have the strongest security possible in place. Many password database manager sites charge a monthly fee, but there is at least one you can download for free.\nClick here to access LastPass' website, which offers a basic version of the service for free.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Yesterday, we talked about the rise of phishing in shared hosting environments. Of course, you probably know that you can be a phishing victim in other types of hosting environments as well. These attacks can be catastrophic for businesses, as well as the individuals whose data is compromised.\nLet’s take a look at the statistics of phishing: how often it occurs, who’s affected, and if there is anything you can do to protect yourself. These statistics and all associated information is compiled from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) April 2013 report, and all data gathered from all over the world represents the latter half of 2012.\nHow Many Attacks Were There, And What Sites Were Affected?\nAccording to the report, 123,486 separate attacks took place worldwide. If you compare that to the 93,462 that took place in the first half of 2012, you’ll see that’s quite the increase. As we discussed in yesterday’s article pertaining to shared hosting, attacks occurring on shared virtual servers allowed multiple domains to be attacked all at the same time.\nBecause of the attack on shared hosting environments, 89,748 separate domain names were compromised. 2,489 of those attacks were exposed on 1,841 separate IP addresses instead of on domain names. It is important to note that none of these phishing attacks took place on IPv6 addresses.\nIPv6 is the latest IP, designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to address the problem they knew would come: the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. It isn’t interoperable with IPv4, but is rather an independent network working in parallel with IPv4. One of the reasons no attacks have taken place could simply be because IPv6 traffic share is only nearing 1%: the majority of internet traffic is still carried on IPv4.\nHacked/Compromised Domains vs. Maliciously Registered Domains\nOut of that 89,748 domain names that were the victim of phishing, the APWG thinks 5,835 domains were maliciously registered by the phishers themselves. That is good, because it appears this practice is declining: 7,712 were labeled as malicious in the first half of 2012, and 14,650 in the beginning of 2011.\nThe rest of the domains were hacked, whether shared or cheap web hosting environments. When it comes to phishers using sub-domain services, the numbers fell here as well: only 14% to 8% of the overall number of attacks.\nPhishers are still relying on URL shortening services to trick phishing URLs, but only 785 phishing attacks such as this took place in the second half of 2012.\nURL shortening is often harmless, like within the Twitter platform, when the number of characters that can be entered is limited. Think Bitly, a URL shortening service that saw their shortened links accessed 2.1 billion times in November 2009. When a spammer or hacker uses URL shortening, it can lead to the shutting down of the URL by their cheap web hosting provider. 65% of shortened URLs found to be malicious were discovered at one provider alone, TinyURL.com.\nAre Some TLDs More Popular For Phishing?\nIt seems that phishers maliciously register domains in only three TLDs: .com, .info, and Thailand’s .tk. Phishers also seem to love Paypal, as it sees 39% of the overall attacks. 48% of phishing domains were .com.\nWhat About Registrars?\n79% of maliciously registered domains appear to have been registered with 21 different registrars, most of them in China. They include Shanghai Yovole Networks; Hang Zhou E-Business Services; Chengdu West Dimension Digital Technology; Intenret.bs; Jiangsu Bangning Science; Melbourne IT; Beijing Innovative; 1API; Directl/PDR; Bizcn.com; Register.com; Xin Net Technology Corp; OVH; GoDaddy; Name.com; Fast Domain; eNom Inc.; tucows; and 1 and 1 Internet AG.\nThere may be no way to fully protect yourself against phishing attacks. However, by staying away from a shared servers and knowing the information that could help you decrease the chances you’ll fall victim, you can make cheap web hosting work for you without compromising your data.\nIs phishing a concern of yours? Have you taken the proper steps to decrease your chances of being a victim?", "label": 1}

{"text": "The Role of XML in Agile Enterprise Architecture, Page 2\nXML Usage in Each Tier\nNow, we've covered a brief introduction to XML, its virtues, and resultant innovation. We've also covered a typical tier structure for describing enterprise architecture. Let's see how XML and XML technologies map to the enterprise tiers.\nOne of the initial uses of XML was to communicate messages between tiers. It didn't matter that tiers may reside on different hardware and software platforms. XML is portable between heterogeneous platforms because it is a standard, self-describing, text-based format. Once XML became prevalent in inter-tier communication, it began to be used intra-tier as well.\nXML's cousin, HTML, has reigned in the client tier. While HTML may not be going away soon, it is changing, and how HTML is generated is changing as well.\nXHTML is HTML that is also a well-formed XML document. It basically turns HTML into an XML vocabulary. Why is this significant? HTML was a bit too lax and forgiving, causing ambiguous markup code and browser compatibility issues. By being well-formed, XHTML improves upon HTML's slackness. It can be parsed with standard XML parsers, queried by XPath, and even transformed via XSLT.\nXSLT, a transformation language for rendering XML into other markup formats, makes it possible to render HTML directly on the client from an XML data source. This provides a clean separation from the data, represented in the XML document, and the presentation, represented in the generated HTML. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are another technology that can be used on the client to present XML documents in a browser and eliminate HTML altogether.\nXForms is a maturing technology that has the potential to revolutionize user interface development. It also separates data from presentation and adds features lacking in HTML forms, such as strong typing, validation, reduced server trips, reduced need for scripting, and an XML representation of form instance data. It provides an XML-friendly manner of data capture.\nBecause of browser compatibility issues with non-standard XSLT implementations, XSLT has also become prevalent in the presentation tier. Often, the view in a MVC framework is implemented in XSLT. In this approach, the stylesheet may be called from the controller to render an XHTML response to the client from an XML source document.\nIt is also becoming more common for the model in MVC to be implemented in XML. With this approach, XML documents might be held in session, accessed via DOM or XPath API, and wrapped by objects to add behavior and encapsulate the XML.\nService-oriented architecture is not a new concept. However, it has gotten a shot in the arm from XML. Web Services—a recent implementation of SOA—owes a debt of gratitude to XML for enabling this technology to flourish and prosper. HTTP and XML have become the standard protocol and payload for sending and receiving messages with the service tier.\nA typical service tier utilizes many XML vocabularies. WSDL (Web Services Definition Language) is a vocabulary for describing a service and its contract. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a vocabulary for passing objects between components in a decentralized distributed environment. There are a plethora of industry standard vocabularies, such as ACORD XML in the insurance industry, used to describe the messages passed in a SOA.\nTo receive and send messages, the service tier uses XML parsing API such as DOM, SAX, and StAX. A service provides an interface to applications, components, and resources which themselves may have an XML-based API. Often, the service will use XSLT to transform requests and responses to and from these components as per the service contract.\nBecause the service payload is in XML, a service management tool usually has the capability to \"mine\" the request and response messages via XPath for relevant auditing, metering, billing, and traceability information.\nOnce XML became prevalent in other tiers, it naturally led to XML being persisted in the resource tier. All relational databases support XML storage in some way. XML databases have emerged as a specialized category of databases for storing XML documents. These databases excel at storing unstructured data, transient data, and configuration data. Because XML Schemas can often be changed without impacting clients, XML provides a very versatile and agile data structure.\nXML is becoming the de facto standard for storing configuration data. It has several advantages over other approaches. A single document can store complex data structures of related meta data elements in a cohesive manner. This document can be versioned in a configuration management tool. Document-oriented meta data can be made available to an application via an XML database, filesystem, or URI. It can be loaded in memory as a DOM and easily queried.\nXML was born in 1997. Its elegant simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and many other virtues have led to wide adoption. XML has inspired many technologies. In enterprise architecture, XML has become the standard for inter-tier communication. Within each tier, XML and XML-related technologies have become pervasive.\nWhy has XML made such an impact in such a short time? Software architectures utilizing XML and XML technologies are more maintainable, portable, reusable, integrable, and testable. XML has tremendously improved agility in enterprise architecture.\nIs XML really boring? How people have used it is rather inspiring. How are you going to use XML and XML technologies to improve your agility today? The rest is up to you!\nAbout the Author\n|Jeff Ryan is an architect for Hartford Financial Services.

{"text": "Many IT organizations today are scratching their heads debating whether the advantages of implementing a Storage Area Network (SAN) solution justify the associated costs. Others are trying to get a handle on today's storage options and whether SAN is simply Network Attached Storage spelled backwards. In this article, I introduce the basic purpose and function of a SAN and examine its role in modern network environments. I also look at how SANs meet the network storage needs of today's organizations and answer the question, could a SAN be right for you.\nPeel away the layers of even the most complex technologies and you are likely to find that they provide the most basic of functions. This is certainly true of storage area networks (SANs). Behind the acronyms and revolutionary headlines, lies a technology designed to provide a way of offering one of the oldest of network services, that of making access to data storage devices available to clients.\nIn very basic terms, a SAN can be anything from two servers on a network accessing a central pool of storage devices to several thousand servers accessing many millions of megabytes of storage. Conceptually, a SAN can be thought of as a separate network of storage devices physically removed from, but still connected to, the network. SANs evolved from the concept of taking storage devices, and therefore storage traffic, off the LAN and creating a separate back-end network designed specifically for data.\nSANs represent the evolution of data storage technology to this point. Traditionally, on client server systems, data was stored on devices either inside or directly attached to the server. Next in the evolutionary scale came Network Attached Storage (NAS) which took the storage devices away from the server and connected them directly to the network. SANs take the principle one step further by allowing storage devices to exist on their own separate network and communicate directly with each other over very fast media. Users can gain access to these storage devices through server systems which are connected to both the LAN and the SAN.\nThis is in contrast to the use of a traditional LAN for providing a connection for server-storage, a strategy that limits overall network bandwidth. SANs address the bandwidth bottlenecks associated with LAN based server storage and the scalability limitations found with SCSI bus based implementations. SANs provide modular scalability, high-availability, increased fault tolerance and centralized storage management. These advantages have led to an increase in the popularity of SANs as they are quite simply better suited to address the data storage needs of today's data intensive network environments.\nThe advantages of SANs are numerous, but perhaps one of the best examples is that of the serverless backup (also commonly referred to as 3rd Party Copying). This system allows a disk storage device to copy data directly to a backup device across the high-speed links of the SAN without any intervention from a server. Data is kept on the SAN, which means the transfer does not pollute the LAN, and the server processing resources are still available to client systems.\nSANs are most commonly implemented using a technology called Fibre channel (yes, that's fibre with an 're', not an 'er'). Fibre Channel is a set of communication standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). These standards define a high-performance data communications technology that supports very fast data rates (over 2Gbps). Fibre channel can be used in a point-to-point configuration between two devices, in a 'ring' type model known as an arbitrated loop, and in a fabric model.\nDevices on the SAN are normally connected together through a special kind of switch, called a Fibre Channel switch, which performs basically the same function as a switch on an Ethernet network, in that it acts as a connectivity point for the devices. Because Fibre channel is a switched technology, it is able to provide a dedicated path between the devices in the fabric so that they can utilize the entire bandwidth for the duration of the communication.\nThe storage devices are connected to Fibre Channel switch using either multimode or single mode fiber optic cable. Multimode for short distances (up to 2 kilometers), single mode for longer. In the storage devices themselves, special fiber channel interfaces provide the connectivity points. These interfaces can take the form of built in adapters, which are commonly found in storage subsystems designed for SANs, or can be interface cards much like a network card, which are installed into server systems.\nSo, the question that remains is this. Should you be moving away from your current storage strategy and towards a SAN? The answer is not a simple one. If you have the need to centralize or streamline your data storage then a SAN may be right for you. There is, of course, one barrier between you and storage heaven, and that's money. While SANs remain the domain of big business, the price tag's of SAN equipment is likely to remain at a level outside the reach of most small or even medium sized businesses. As the prices fall, however, SANs will find their way into organizations of all sizes, including, if you want, yours.\nYour White Papers Search Results\nThe Top Ten Headaches Caused by Remote Office Storage\nIT directors at growing, distributed enterprises face a number of unique challenges, particularly when it comes to storage.

Yay, technology?\nNew Scientist reports that a new microchip-sized digital camera, developed by the California Institute of Technology using funding from NASA and the Pentagon, has been patented and is expected to replace current camera technology on the tiny spy drones. According to the article, the revolutionary aspect of the design is that the new size means that the main power drain on existing minicams - connecting the chips for the sensors and support circuitry - is no longer necessary, making the new remote controlled camera use much less energy, and therefore be more suited for secret surveillance missions. I'm not sure how I feel about this news, not least of all because I didn't even know that the US military even had insect-sized surveillance drones before.\nSpying roboflies to get minicam eyes [New Scientist]", "label": 1}
{"text": "Air Force Research Lab's vision for military MAVs\nIn a recent blog post we've asked if autonomous battlefield robots can behave more ethically than humans. But today's weaponized robots are not the only ones that raise ethical concerns. The development of miniature robots will soon allow surveillance to move out of the cyberspace, bringing privacy concerns to a new level.\nA video released by the Air Force Research Laboratory and published via the Chicago Tribune now shows how the military envisions the future use of micro air vehicles (MAVs) for both, surveillance and direct attack missions using chemical or explosive payloads.\nThe video shows a swarm of MAVs being dropped out of a high flying airplane and then goes on to explain how the MAVs could be hidden in plain sight, for example disguised as flies or doves. It envisions MAVs forming sensor networks to enhance their sensing and operating capabilities, and harvesting their energy from the environment including power lines to extend their mission time indefinitely.", "label": 1}
{"text": "What are common sources of threats to mobile devices or the health information on them?\nThe United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently issued a report to Congress called “Information Security: Better Implementation of Controls for Mobile Devices Should Be Encouraged.” The Report identified mobile device threat sources such as hackers, cybercriminals and Botnet operators. The Report explains how threat sources get control of or gain access to information on mobile devices.\n- Botnet Operators: Botnet operators widely distribute malware to mobile devices and coordinate remotely controlled attacks on websites. They also distribute phishing schemes, spam, and malware attacks on individual mobile devices.\n- Cybercriminals: Cyber criminals attack mobile devices for money. They gain access to information stored on a mobile device using spam, phishing or spyware/malware and use the information to commit identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion. International criminal organizations attack mobile devices to conduct industrial espionage and large-scale money and intellectual property theft, posing a threat to corporations, institutions and government agencies.\n- Hackers: Hackers sometimes attack mobile devices to show their skills or gain prestige in the hacker community. Hacking used to require computer skills and knowledge, but today’s hackers can download attack scripts and protocols from the Internet and launch them against mobile devices.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The digital signatures play a vital role in the organizations since this technology enables the businesses to reduce the human errors, ultimately minimizes the paper work. Digital signatures enable the businesses to manage their monetary subsidiary and cost of paper work. Also, these signatures help the companies in proving that they’re utilizing the green policies and eco friendly procedures by cutting back the use of paper.\nThis vast technology even reduces the time consumed in sending numerous emails and documents, since the entire work is entitled in few moments. The corporations prove their sharp time management skills through this technology.\nWhat does a digital signature actually do?\nMost businesses use the digital signatures for the different types of paper transactions. These signatures analyze and approve the documents directly, as the whole information is preserved digitally by them. Thus, there is no more need to move to various locations for documents approval.\nNowadays, most of the companies and corporations in the market are adopting this technology for business purposes. The great thing about it is that it’s an efficient and safe method that ensures the security and reliability of the confidential information. Since, it’s a secure method most of the companies use this technology. Digital signatures enable the huge companies and businesses to store and secure their essential documents digitally.\nWhat’s the role of digital encryption in the digital signatures process?\nThe digital signatures technique has one aspect named as digital encryption that is significant in the whole procedure of this method. This technology enables the companies to acknowledge and authenticate the user’s id. Digital encryption can validate various kinds of digitally stored contents and documents.\nOften the digitally stored files ensure that their content won’t be accessed and attacked through an illegal process. The hash methods and numerical values are used to protect the data. In order to access the information the users are asked to follow the validation procedures to generate the permission and after the validation the user will be able to access the information.\nIn this whole procedure if the user tries to access or copy the data illegally the system never allows the user to do it because the keys entered by him won’t match certain authentication keys. Thus, he won’t be able to get into the documents stored by the digital signatures. First the confirmation is asked to the receiver, thus the authenticity totally lies on the reliability of the user.\nSignificance of protective measures in digital signatures:\nAs different kinds of variations occur in computer networks with time, the protection and authentication methods are hugely required to secure the information. Protection is required in every facet, so various kinds of strategies and processes should be applied to maintain the aspects related with security.\nGenerally, the digital signatures are applied for different functions and its major function is to store and protect the confidential information. This major function involves in identifying the user, who is requesting to access the information and sending the security messages to the user.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cloud computing technology is deployed in three general types, based on the level of internal or external ownership and the technical merits: public cloud (external), private cloud (internal), or hybrid cloud.\nPublic cloud is the provision of cloud computing services whereby applications, storage and other resources are shared among multiple customers over the internet or a private network, with varying degrees of data privacy control.\nPrivate cloud uses similar computing architectures to the public cloud, but is generally built, managed and used internally by an enterprise.\nHybrid cloud is a mix of public cloud services, internal cloud computing architectures and traditional IT infrastructure, forming a hybrid model that meets the specific needs of the customers.\nTax treatment of cloud computing\nThere is no comprehensive set of US guidance for the tax treatment of cloud computing (e.g. characterization, sourcing and reporting obligations). The US Treasury instead adapts existing tax principles to the cloud rather than creating new or additional tax regimes.\nCharacterization of income\nThe character of the income earned from cloud computing drives the tax determinations of the treatment and the reporting obligations. Though the rules are not immediately clear, the character classification generally depends on the nature of the underlying interest that is granted to the customers as part of their access. Where the cloud operator earns income by providing access to applications, software, or storage, the transaction could be characterized as either a transfer of a computer program (sale or license) or a service provision that generates services income.\nThe character of payments to a cloud computing provider generally depends on the following (non-exclusive) factors:\n- Whether any derivative rights (such as the rights to make copies for purposes of distribution or to prepare derivative work) relating to the application or software were transferred as part of the access.\n- Whether the customers have physical possession of or control over their access to the software.\n- Whether the customers bear the risk associated with the maintenance of the software or application.\n- Whether the customers have exclusive access to the applications and software.\nThe determination will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the arrangement. Generally, a transaction involving a computer program will be treated as a sales transaction if, subsequent to the transaction, the customer receives all substantial rights and bears the relevant benefits and risks of ownership with respect to the program. A transaction will be treated as a license if less than all substantial rights are transferred. Finally, a transaction will generally be treated as a provision of services if the customer merely has access to the computer program and does not bear the benefits and risks associated with ownership.\nSource of income\nThe source of income depends on the underlying character of the income. Generally, sales income is sourced where title and risk of loss is transferred; royalty income is sourced where the underlying right or property is used or protected; and services income is sourced at the location where the services are performed.\nEven after the character of income has been determined, the source of income analysis may still not be straightforward. For example, for services income, there is little guidance over where the services are considered to be performed for business activities conducted over the Internet. Applicable authorities suggest that the US tax authorities may treat the services as being performed at the location of the servers, provided there is limited human or additional outside involvement in the provision of the services.\nThe source of income can affect whether the income from cloud services will be taxable in the US, and whether withholding taxes are imposed on payments received from its cloud computing transactions.\nCorporate income tax\nCloud computing providers that are treated as tax residents of the US are generally subject to tax at the graduated corporate income tax rate on all income earned, regardless of its source.\nForeign corporations that provide cloud computing services (foreign opcos) are generally subject to corporate income tax in the US where their business income is connected with a US trade or business.\nA Foreign OpCo will generally be treated as conducting a US trade or business if it conducts considerable, continuous and regular business activities in the US. In addition, a Foreign OpCo may be treated as having a US trade or business through the activities of its agent, if the agent has the ability to bind or conclude contracts on behalf of the principal.\nThere are no clear rules on whether a Foreign OpCo should be treated as having engaged in a US trade or business as a result of utilizing servers in the US. However, if the US servers function as a critical part of a foreign opco’s business operations, such fact may be sufficient for US tax authorities to argue that the Foreign OpCo engages in considerable, continuous and regular business activities in the US and therefore has a US trade or business.\nIf a Foreign OpCo has a US trade or business, it is required to file a US federal income tax return, regardless of whether it has any income subject to tax during the taxable year. Nonetheless, the amount of income subject to US tax may be reduced or wholly exempted if the opco qualifies for benefits under an applicable US income tax treaty.\nIncome tax treaty and permanent establishment\nIf a Foreign OpCo qualifies for benefits under an applicable US income tax treaty, certain business income earned may be exempted from US corporate income tax. In most US income tax treaties, a Foreign OpCo must generally meet the requirements of the Limitation on Benefits Article to qualify for benefits under the treaty. While the specifics of the tests vary from treaty to treaty, a Foreign OpCo generally qualifies for benefits if it meets one of the following tests:\n- test based solely on ownership\n- ownership/base erosion test\n- active trade or business test.\nWhere a Foreign OpCo earns business income that qualifies for benefits under an income tax treaty, it may be exempted from US corporate income tax if it does not have a permanent establishment (PE) in the US. In determining whether a particular cloud provider has a PE in the US, one must consider the location of the servers used by the provider, and the outside functions that may be required to operate the cloud computing operations.\nUS tax authorities generally adopt the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) approach, published in its commentary on e-Commerce, which considers an enterprise to have a PE at the location of the server, but only if the enterprise has the server at its own disposal. There are no specific criteria for determining when an enterprise may be considered to have a server at its disposal. However, the OECD commentary on PEs generally states that if a taxpayer owns (or leases) and operates the server, it may be treated as having a server at its disposal and, therefore, a PE.\nThus, if a Foreign OpCo conducts its cloud operations through servers located in the US, there is a risk that it will be treated as having a US PE. However, where its cloud operations also require additional human intervention or other functions to be performed outside of the US, the Foreign OpCo may allocate portions of the income earned to those functions in accordance with the profit attribution principles under the treaty.\nA Foreign OpCo may be subject to US withholding tax if it earns US source income that is treated as fixed, determinable, annual and periodic (FDAP) income that is not effectively connected with a US trade or business. FDAP income is defined broadly to include most income that is not derived from gain from the sale of property. In cloud computing, typical FDAP income that may arise includes royalty, interest and dividend payments.\nIf a Foreign OpCo earns US source FDAP income that is not connected with a US trade or business, such income will generally be subject to a 30 percent US withholding tax. The withhold tax on FDAP income may be reduced or wholly exempted if the Foreign OpCo qualifies for benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.\nUS trade or business analysis\nForeign OpCo may be treated as having a US trade or business in this case, because it is using its parent company’s US servers to accept orders from its customers. In addition, Foreign OpCo may also be treated as having a US trade or business based on the use of the server co’s US servers to host the platform that the customers access. Though reasonable arguments could be made otherwise, the significance of the US servers to the Foreign OpCo’s business operations is probably sufficient for US tax authorities to argue that Foreign OpCo has a US trade or business.\nIf Foreign OpCo is treated as having a US trade or business, it will be subject to US tax on its US source income, either as income connected to a US trade or business (subject to graduated corporate income tax) or FDAP (subject to a 30 percent withholding). As previously discussed, the source of income will depend on the income tax characterization of the payments.\nIf payments for access to the digital platform are treated as payments for the provision of services, the payments may be sourced in the US based on the location of the servers. Such US source income would generally be treated as effectively connected to foreign opco’s US trade or business if the income is derived from assets used in foreign opco’s conduct of a US trade or business, or if the activities of foreign opco’s US trade or business constitute a material factor in the realization of income.\nAssuming Foreign OpCo qualifies for benefits under an applicable income tax treaty, any income that is connected to a US trade or business may be exempted from US taxation if Foreign OpCo can establish that it does not have a US PE. In this case, Foreign OpCo may be treated as having a US PE through the activities of both server co and its US parent.\nA Foreign OpCo may argue that the activities of the server co should not establish a US PE on its behalf, if server company is legally and economically independent and does not otherwise act for or on behalf of the Foreign OpCo.\nThe Foreign OpCo may have more difficulty establishing that its US parent is not its agent, because the parent has (and exercises) the authority to bind Foreign OpCo when the parent accepts the order on the US servers. Unless additional facts exist to establish that the parent acts as the principal and compensates the Foreign OpCo for its marketing services, it is likely that the Foreign OpCo will be treated as having a US PE as a result of its agency relationship with the US parent. As a result, the Foreign OpCo’s income that is attributable to the US PE will be subject to corporate income tax in the US.\nRelated party transactions\nIf taxpayers engage in related party transactions as part of their cloud operations, such transactions are generally subject to US transfer pricing principles under Section 482. Generally, taxpayers that engage in related-party or controlled transactions may be subject to adjustments and allocations of income and deductions by the US tax authorities, if the transaction does not meet the arm’s length standard under Section 482.\nIn order to avoid transfer pricing adjustment-related penalties, taxpayers must maintain adequate transfer pricing documentation that meets the regulatory guidelines.\nState income tax\nThere are two key state income tax issues that cloud computing providers should address. First, does the enterprise have sufficient connection (nexus) in a particular state that would create an obligation to file state income tax returns? Second, if the enterprise has nexus in the state, does the enterprise have to include income from cloud computing when determining the state’s apportionment formula?\nStates generally have not issued comprehensive or uniform guidance on how a cloud computing arrangement should be treated and taxed. As a result, enterprises that provide cloud computing services should analyze on a state-by-state basis whether and how much of their income from cloud operations should be subject to state income tax.\nSales and use tax\nIn addition to state income tax, most states also impose sales and use tax collection responsibility on businesses that operate within their jurisdiction. Generally, the character of the transaction and source of the income derived from the transaction are the issues that need to be analyzed for sales and use tax purposes.\nMost states have not issued guidance on how the traditional sales and use tax principles should be applied to the provision of cloud computing services. To the extent that guidance has been issued, it is often limited and differs for each jurisdiction. As there can be significant differences between the states on how the same cloud computing transaction should be treated, cloud providers (and to some extent, their customers) should carefully analyze the transaction on a state-by-state basis, to determine whether they have any sales and use tax obligation.", "label": 1}
{"text": "What you can do about spyware and other unwanted software\nWhat is spyware?\nSpyware is a general term used for software that performs certain behaviors such as advertising, collecting personal information, or changing the configuration of your computer, generally without appropriately obtaining your consent. You might have spyware or other unwanted software on your computer if:\n? You see pop-up advertisements even when you're not on the Web.\n? The page your Web browser first opens to (your home page) or your browser search settings have changed without your knowledge.\n? You notice a new toolbar in your browser that you didn't want, and find it difficult to get rid of.\n? Your computer takes longer than usual to complete certain tasks.\n? You experience a sudden rise in computer crashes.\nSpyware is often associated with software that displays advertisements (called adware) or software that tracks personal or sensitive information. That does not mean all software which provides ads or tracks your online activities is bad. For example, you might sign up for a free music service, but \"pay\" for the service by agreeing to receive targeted ads. If you understand the terms and agree to them, you may have decided that it is a fair tradeoff. You might also agree to let the company track your online activities to determine which ads to show you.\nOther kinds of unwanted software will make changes to your computer that can be annoying and can cause your computer slow down or crash. These programs have the ability to change your Web browser's home page or search page, or add additional components to your browser you don't need or want. These programs also make it very difficult for you to change your settings back to the way you originally had them. These types of unwanted programs are also often called spyware.\nThe key in all cases is whether or not you (or someone who uses your computer) understand what the software will do and have agreed to install the software on your computer.\nThere are a number of ways spyware or other unwanted software can get on your system. A common trick is to covertly install the software during the installation of other software you want such as a music or video file sharing program. Whenever you are installing something on your computer, make sure you carefully read all disclosures, including the license agreement and privacy statement. Sometimes the inclusion of unwanted software in a given software installation is documented, but it may appear at the end of a license agreement or privacy statement.\nSigns of spyware\nIf your computer starts to behave strangely or displays any of the symptoms listed below, you may have spyware or other unwanted software installed on your computer.\n? I see pop-up advertisements all the time. Some unwanted software will bombard you with pop-up ads that aren't related to a particular Web site you're visiting. These ads are often for adult or other Web sites you may find objectionable. If you see pop-up ads as soon as you turn on your computer or when you're not even browsing the Web, you may have spyware or other unwanted software on your computer.\n? My settings have changed and I can't change them back to the way they were. Some unwanted software has the ability to change your home page or search page settings. This means that the page that opens first when you start your Internet browser or the page that appears when you select \"search\" may be pages that you do not recognize. Even if you know how to adjust these settings, you may find that they revert back every time you restart your computer.\n? My Web browser contains additional components that I don't remember downloading. Spyware and other unwanted software can add additional toolbars to your Web browser that you don't want or need. Even if you know how to remove these toolbars, they may return each time you restart your computer.\n? My computer seems sluggish. Spyware and other unwanted software are not necessarily designed to be efficient. The resources these programs use to track your activities and deliver advertisements can slow down your computer and errors in the software can make your computer crash. If you notice a sudden increase in the number of times a certain program crashes, or if your computer is slower than normal at performing routine tasks, you may have spyware or other unwanted software on your machine.\nHow to get rid of spyware\nMany kinds of unwanted software, including spyware, are designed to be difficult to remove. If you try to uninstall this software like any other program, you might find that the program reappears as soon as you restart your computer. If you're having trouble uninstalling unwanted software, you may need to download a tool to do the job for you. Several companies offer free and low-cost software that will check your computer for spyware and other unwanted software and help you remove it.\nSome Internet Service Providers (ISPs) include anti-spyware software in their service packages. Check with your ISP to see if they can recommend or provide a tool. If your ISP doesn't offer a removal tool for spyware and other unwanted software, ask people you trust to recommend one, or see the list below for a few well-known tools. Keep in mind that removing unwanted software with these tools may mean you will no longer be able to use a free program that came with the spyware.\nTo remove spyware\n1. Download the new Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware (Beta) or another spyware removal tool.\n2. Run the tool to scan your computer for spyware and other unwanted software.\n3. Review the files discovered by the tool for spyware and other unwanted software.\n4. Select suspicious files for removal by following the tool's instructions.\nHow to prevent spyware\nSpyware and other unwanted software can invade your privacy, bombard you with pop-up windows, slow down your computer, and even make your computer crash. Here are several ways you can help protect your computer against spyware and other unwanted software.\nStep 1: Update your software\nIf you use Windows XP, one way to help prevent spyware and other unwanted software is to make sure all your software is updated. First, visit Windows Update to confirm that you have Automatic Updates turned on and that you've downloaded all the latest critical and security updates.\nStep 2: Adjust Internet Explorer security settings\nYou can adjust your Internet Explorer Web browser's security settings to determine how much?or how little?information you are willing to accept from a Web site. Microsoft recommends that you set the security settings for the Internet zone to Medium or higher.\nTo view your current Internet Explorer security settings:\n1. In Internet Explorer, click Tools and then click Internet Options.\n2. Select the Security tab.\nIf you're running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and you use Internet Explorer to browse the Web, your browser security settings for the Internet zone are already set to Medium by default. Internet Explorer in Windows XP SP2 also includes a number of features to help protect against spyware and many other kinds of deceptive or unwanted software.\nStep 3: Use a firewall\nWhile most spyware and other unwanted software come bundled with other programs or originate from unscrupulous Web sites, a small amount of spyware can actually be placed on your computer remotely by hackers. Installing a firewall or using the firewall that's built into Windows XP provides a helpful defense against these hackers. To learn more about firewalls, read Why you should use a computer firewall and get answers to your Frequently asked questions about firewalls.\nStep 4: Surf and download more safely\nThe best defense against spyware and other unwanted software is not to download it in the first place. Here are a few helpful tips that can protect you from downloading software you don't want:\n? Only download programs from Web sites you trust. If you're not sure whether to trust a program you are considering downloading, ask a knowledgeable friend or enter the name of the program into your favorite search engine to see if anyone else has reported that it contains spyware.\n? Read all security warnings, license agreements, and privacy statements associated with any software you download.\n? Never click \"agree\" or \"OK\" to close a window. Instead, click the red \"x\" in the corner of the window or press the Alt + F4 buttons on your keyboard to close a window.\n? Be wary of popular \"free\" music and movie file-sharing programs, and be sure you clearly understand all of the software packaged with those programs.\nStep 5: Download and install anti-spyware protection\nMicrosoft currently offers anti-spyware beta software for download; more information is available on our Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware (Beta) site.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cybercriminals using digitally signed Java exploits to trick users\n- — 05 March, 2013 17:52\nSecurity researchers warn that cybercriminals have started using Java exploits signed with digital certificates to trick users into allowing the malicious code to run inside browsers.\nA signed Java exploit was discovered Monday on a website belonging to the Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany that was infected with a Web exploit toolkit called g01pack, security researcher Eric Romang said Tuesday in a blog post.\n\"It's definitely go01 pack,\" Jindrich Kubec, director of threat intelligence at antivirus vendor Avast, said via email. The first sample of this signed Java exploit was detected on Feb. 28, he said.\nIt was not immediately clear if this exploit targets a new vulnerability or an older Java flaw that has already been patched. Oracle released new Java security updates on Monday to address two critical vulnerabilities, one of which was being actively exploited by attackers.\nJava exploits have traditionally been delivered as unsigned applets -- Java Web applications. The execution of such applets used to be automated in older Java versions, which allowed hackers to launch drive-by download attacks that were completely transparent to the victims.\nStarting with the January release of Java 7 Update 11, the default security controls for Web-based Java content are set to high, prompting users for confirmation before applets are allowed to run inside browsers, regardless of whether they are digitally signed or not.\nThat said, using signed exploits over unsigned ones does provide benefits for attackers, because the confirmation dialogs displayed by Java in the two cases are considerably different. The dialogs for unsigned Java applets are actually titled \"Security Warning.\"\nDigital signing is an important part of assuring users they can trust your code, Bogdan Botezatu, a senior e-threat analyst at antivirus vendor Bitdefender, said via email. The confirmation dialog displayed for signed code is much more discrete and less threatening than the one displayed in the case of unsigned code, he said.\n\"Additionally, Java itself processes signed and unsigned code differently and enforces security restrictions appropriately,\" Botezatu said. For example, if the Java security settings are set to \"very high,\" unsigned applets won't run at all, while signed applets will run if the user confirms the action. In corporate environments where very high Java security settings are enforced, code signing may be the only way for attackers to run a malicious applet on a targeted system, he said.\nThis new Java exploit has also brought to light the fact that Java does not check for digital certificate revocations by default.\nThe exploit found by researchers Monday was signed with a digital certificate that's most likely stolen. The certificate was issued by Go Daddy to a company called Clearesult Consulting based in Austin, Texas, and was subsequently revoked with a date of Dec 7, 2012.\nCertificate revocations can apply retroactively and it's not clear when exactly Go Daddy flagged the certificate for revocation. However, on Feb. 25, three days before the oldest sample of this exploit was detected, the certificate was already listed as revoked in the certificate revocation list published by the company, Kubec said. Despite this, Java sees the certificate as valid.\nOn the \"Advanced\" tab of the Java control panel, under the \"Advanced security settings\" category, there are two options called \"Check certificates for revocation using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)\" and \"Enable online certificate validation\" -- the second option uses OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol). Both of these options are disabled by default.\nOracle does not have any comment about this issue at this time, Oracle's PR agency in the U.K. said Tuesday via email.\n\"Sacrificing security for convenience is a serious security oversight, especially as Java has been the most targeted third-party piece of software since November 2012,\" Botezatu said. However, Oracle is not alone in this, the researcher said, noting that Adobe ships Adobe Reader 11 with an important sandbox mechanism disabled by default for usability reasons.\nBoth Botezatu and Kubec are convinced that attackers will increasingly start using digitally signed Java exploits in order to bypass Java's new security restrictions more easily.\nSecurity firm Bit9 recently revealed that hackers compromised one of its digital certificates and used it to sign malware. Last year, hackers did the same with a compromised digital certificate from Adobe.\nThose incidents and this new Java exploit are proof that valid digital certificates can end up signing malicious code, Botezatu said. In this context, actively checking for certificate revocations is particularly important because it is the only mitigation available in case of certificate compromise, he said.\nUsers who require Java in a browser on a daily basis should consider enabling certificate revocation checking to better protect against attacks exploiting stolen certificates, said Adam Gowdiak, the founder of Polish vulnerability research firm Security Explorations, via email. Security Explorations researchers have found and reported over 50 Java vulnerabilities in the past year.\nWhile users should manually enable these certificate revocation options, many of them will probably not do it considering that they don't even install security updates, Kubec said. The researcher hopes that Oracle will turn on the feature automatically in a future update.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Phishing has always been one of the most common e-mail threats, but it has now become a fairly difficult threat to detect and block. As we noted earlier in the year, the content of phishing emails has become essentially identical to legitimate messages.\nFrom the point of view of blocking and detecting email based on content, this is a serious issue. Because they are so similar to legitimate emails, any pattern likely to detect these phishing messages is also likely to detect many legitimate messages. This would raise the number of false positives to unacceptable levels.\nDetecting phishing emails based on analyzing URLs also presents a challenge because phishing sites are going down very quickly after they go online. According to the Global Phishing Survey report for the first half of 2012 that was released by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, the average uptime of a phishing site is now down to below 24 hours, with the median uptime just below six hours. This means that there is now relatively limited time to analyze and detect malicious sites, potentially reducing the effectivity of URLs for detecting phishing messages.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Air Force to launch robotic winged space planeApril 3rd, 2010 in Space & Earth / Space Exploration\n(AP) -- After a decade of development, the Air Force this month plans to launch a robotic spacecraft resembling a small space shuttle to conduct technology tests in orbit and then glide home to a California runway.\nThe ultimate purpose of the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle and details about the craft, which has been passed between several government agencies, however, remain a mystery as it is prepared for launch April 19 from Cape Canaveral, Fla.\n\"As long as you're confused you're in good shape,\" said defense analyst John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org. \"I looked into this a couple of years ago - the entire sort of hypersonic, suborbital, scramjet nest of programs - of which there are upwards of a dozen. The more I studied it the less I understood it.\"\nThe quietly scheduled launch culminates the project's long and expensive journey from NASA to the Pentagon's research and development arm and then to a secretive Air Force unit.\nHundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the X-37 program, but the current total has not been released.\nThe launch date, landing sites and a fact sheet were released by Air Force spokeswoman Maj. Angie I. Blair. She said more information would be released soon, but questions on cost and other matters submitted by e-mail weren't answered by Friday.\nWhile the massive space shuttles have been likened to cargo-hauling trucks, the X-37B is more like a sports car, with the equivalent trunk capacity.\nBuilt by Boeing Co.'s Phantom Works, the 11,000-pound craft is 9 1/2 feet tall and just over 29 feet long, with a wingspan of less than 15 feet. It has two angled tail fins rather than a single vertical stabilizer.\nUnlike the shuttle, it will be launched like a satellite, housed in a fairing atop an expendable Atlas V rocket, and deploy solar panels to provide electrical power in orbit.\nThe Air Force released only a general description of the mission objectives: testing of guidance, navigation, control, thermal protection and autonomous operation in orbit, re-entry and landing.\nThe mission's length was not released but the Air Force said the X-37B can stay in orbit for 270 days. The primary landing site will be northwest of Los Angeles at coastal Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nThe significance of the X-37B is unclear because the program has been around for so long, said Peter A. Wilson, a senior defense research analyst for the RAND Corp. who several years ago served as executive director of a congressional panel that evaluated national security space launch requirements.\n\"From my perspective it's a little puzzling as to whether this is the beginning of a program or the end of one,\" Wilson said Friday in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.\nAs NASA anticipated the end of the shuttle, the X-37B was viewed as a working prototype of the next-generation design of a fully reusable spacecraft, but the space agency lost interest and the Air Force picked it up, Wilson said.\n\"It's viewed as a prototype of a vehicle that could carry small payloads into orbit, carry out a variety of military missions and then return to Earth,\" he said.\nThe Air Force statement said the X-37 program is being used \"to continue full-scale development\" and orbital testing of a long-duration, reusable space vehicle.\nWilson sees the upcoming launch as \"a one-shot deal.\"\nHe acknowledged that he does not know if there is a classified portion of the program but said there is no evidence of a second vehicle being built to follow the prototype. In aerospace, a prototype typically remains a test vehicle used to prove and improve designs for successive operational vehicles.\nTo fully function as a completely reusable launch system there would also have to be development of a booster rocket that is capable of landing itself back on Earth to be reassembled with the spacecraft, according to Wilson, who does not see any support for such an initiative.\nWilson also said the usefulness of payloads such as small military satellites is in question, which would undercut the need for the launch system.\nThe X-37B is now under the direction of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. Its mission is to speed up development of combat-support systems and weapons systems.\nOperating since 2003, the office has worked on several things, including upgrading the air defenses around the nation's capital as an anti-terrorism measure and assessing threats to U.S. combat operations, according to an Air Force fact sheet.\nNASA began the X-37 program in 1999 in a cooperative deal with Boeing to roughly split the $173 million cost of developing an experimental space plane. The Air Force put in a small share.\nThe X-37, initially intended to be carried into space by shuttles in 2003, was a larger version of the Air Force X-40A, a concept for a \"Space Maneuver Vehicle\" to put small military satellites in orbit. The X-40A was dropped from a helicopter in glide and landing tests but was never capable of actual space flight.\nIn 2002, NASA awarded Boeing a $301 million contract to complete a version of the X-37 to be used in approach and landing tests and begin designing an orbital version that would fly in 2006.\nBut in 2004 NASA turned the project over to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Department's research and development arm. In 2006, the X-37 was put through captive-carry and drop tests using Mojave-based Scaled Composite LLC's White Knight, the jet that launched SpaceShipOne on the first private suborbital manned space flights.\nThe Air Force then began work on the X-37B, projecting it would fly in 2008. An Air Force News story at the time reported that the first one or two flights would check out the performance of the vehicle itself and then it would become a space test platform with unspecified components flown in its experiment bay.\n©2010 The Associated Press.

{"text": "What different types of security do there exist? Why and when should they be implemented?\nExample: SQL Injection Prevention\nPreventing Buffer overflow\nI cannot count the exploit that are based on this.\nI am no expert, but in my experience, there are several well-known attack vectors for systems:\nUnvalidated user data\nThis is the classic buffer-overrun, SQL injection, drive-by-download mechanism and is caused by insufficient planning or education on secure coding practices. It is important to ensure developers understand how any insecure code can be leveraged to exploit a zero-day attack on a computer. Just because your website doesn't do anything particularly secret/important, doesn't mean that getting root access on your webserver can't harm the other parts of the organisation.\nThis can be a blend of poor security infrastructure, policy or just bad passwords. The worlds most popular password is 'password1' since most email providers started insisting on alpha-numeric passwords - previously it was 'password'. If a dictionary-based attack can guess a users' password, the policy was insufficient.\nSome enterprising programmers leave quick-access backdoors in code in case they need to jump in and 'fix' the system. If you have any of these, deliberate or otherwise, your system is a ticking time-bomb.\nWhat to do about it\nIt depends completely on the type of app, what a potential exploit might accomplish and the expected environment.\nIf you are running in an environment assumed to be safe then you could argue few to none.\nIf you are writing a web app that is publicly exposed, or an app that involves a publicly exposed API you would have to think through the likely scenarios like defacement, false submissions, authentication exploits, getting access to data not belonging to you, etc.\nIf you are building an app that stores data locally you might need to be concerned with the security of that data, keeping it separate between users on a multi-user system, etc.\nIMHO there are not any security concerns that are ALWAYS applicable in every situation.\nBased on the number of attacks - see stats by Verizon, OWASP, WHID and others - the single biggest thing you can do to improve the security of a web application is implement solid input validation. Do not trust anything the client/browser sends you. This will pretty much sort your SQL injection issue, and help out in a number of other areas including field/buffer overflow.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Windows Azure Networking\nThe easiest way to connect to Windows Azure applications and data is through an ordinary Internet connection. But this simple solution isn’t always the best approach. Windows Azure also provides technologies for connecting users to Windows Azure datacenters. This article takes a look at these technologies.\nTable of Contents\nWindows Azure Virtual Network\nWindows Azure lets you create virtual machines (VMs) that run in Microsoft datacenters. Suppose your organization wants to use those VMs to run enterprise applications or other software that will be used by your firm’s employees. Maybe you want to create a SharePoint farm in the cloud, for example, or run an inventory management application. To make life as easy as possible for your users, you’d like these applications to be accessible just as if they were running in your own datacenter.\nThere’s a standard solution to this kind of problem: create a virtual private network (VPN). Organizations of all sizes do this today to link, say, branch office computers to the main company datacenter. This same approach can work with Windows Azure VMs, as Figure 1 shows.\nFigure 1: Windows Azure Virtual Network allows creating a virtual network in the cloud that’s connected to your on-premises datacenter.\nAs the figure shows, Windows Azure Virtual Network lets you create a logical boundary around a group of VMs, called a virtual network or VNET, in a Windows Azure datacenter. It then lets you establish an IPsec connection between this VNET and your local network. The VMs in a VNET can be created using Windows Azure Virtual Machines, Windows Azure Cloud Services, or both. In other words, they can be VMs created using either Windows Azure’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) technology or its Platform as a Service (PaaS) technology. Whatever choice you make, creating the IPsec connection requires a VPN gateway device, specialized hardware that’s attached to your local network, and it also requires the services of your network administrator. Once this connection is in place, the Windows Azure VMs running in your VNET look like just another part of your organization’s network.\nAs Figure 1 suggests, you allocate IP addresses for the Windows Azure VMs from the same IP address space used in your own network. In the scenario shown here, which uses private IP addresses, the VMs in the cloud are just another IP subnet. Software running on your local network will see these VMs as if they were local, just as they do with traditional VPNs. And it’s important to note that because this connection happens at the IP level, the virtual and physical machines on both sides can be running any operating system. Windows Azure VMs running Windows Server or Linux can interact with on-premises machines running Windows, Linux, or other systems. It’s also possible to use mainstream management tools, including System Center and others, to manage the cloud VMs and the applications they contain.\nUsing Windows Azure Virtual Network makes sense in many situations. As already mentioned, this approach lets enterprise users more easily access cloud applications. An important aspect of this ease of use is the ability to make the Windows Azure VMs part of an existing on-premises Active Directory domain to give users single sign-on to the applications they run. You can also create an Active Directory domain in the cloud if you prefer, then connect this domain to your on-premises network.\nCreating a VNET in a Windows Azure datacenter effectively gives you access to a large pool of on-demand resources. You can create VMs on demand, pay for them while they’re running, then remove them (and stop paying) when you no longer need them. This can be useful for scenarios that need fast access to a preconfigured machine, such as development teams building new software. Rather than wait for a local administrator to set up the resources they need, they can create these resources themselves in the public cloud.\nAnd just as Virtual Network makes Windows Azure VMs appear local to on-premises resources, the reverse is also true: Software running in your local network now appears to be local to applications running in your Windows Azure VNET. Suppose you’d like to move an existing on-premises application to Windows Azure, for example, because you’ve determined that it will be less expensive to operate in the cloud. But what if the data that application uses is required by law to be stored on premises? In a situation like this, using Virtual Network lets the cloud application see an on-premises database system as if it were local—accessing it becomes straightforward. Whatever scenario you choose, the result is the same: Windows Azure becomes an extension of your own datacenter.\nWindows Azure Traffic Manager\nImagine that you’ve built a successful Windows Azure application. Your app is used by many people in many countries around the world. This is a great thing, but as is so often the case, success brings new problems. Here, for instance, your application most likely runs in multiple Windows Azure datacenters in different parts of the world. How can you intelligently route traffic across these datacenters so that your users always get the best experience?\nWindows Azure Traffic Manager is designed to solve this problem. Figure 3 shows how.\nFigure 3: Windows Azure Traffic Manager intelligently directs requests from users across instances of an application running in different Windows Azure datacenters.\nIn this example, your application is running in VMs spread across four datacenters: two in the US, one in Europe, and one in Asia. Suppose a user in Berlin wishes to access the application. If you’re using Traffic Manager, here’s what happens.\nAs usual, the user’s system looks up the DNS name of the application (step 1). This query is redirected to the Windows Azure DNS system (step 2), which then looks up the Traffic Manager policy for this application. Each policy is created by the owner of a particular Windows Azure application, either through a graphical interface or a REST API. However it’s created, the policy specifies one of three options:\n- Performance: All requests are sent to the closest datacenter.\n- Failover: All requests are sent to the datacenter specified by the creator of this policy, unless that datacenter is unavailable. In this case, requests are routed to other datacenters in the priority order defined by the policy’s creator.\n- Round Robin: All requests are spread equally across all datacenters in which the application is running.\nOnce it has the right policy, Traffic Manager figures out which datacenter this request should go to based on which of the three options is specified (step 3). It then returns the location of the chosen datacenter to the user (step 4), who accesses that instance of the application (step 5).\nFor this to work, Traffic Manager must have a current picture of which instances of the application are up and running in each datacenter. To make this possible, Traffic Manager periodically pings each copy of the application via an HTTP GET, then records whether it receives a response. If an application instance stops responding, Traffic Manager will stop sending traffic to that instance until it resumes responding to pings.\nNot every application is big enough or global enough to need Traffic Manager. For those that do, however, this can be a quite useful service.", "label": 1}

{"text": "You have probably received emails from associates warning you to be aware of a specific \"virus\"; if you did, you have most likely been the victim of a virus hoax. The DOT-COMmunications' helpdesk receives more calls about virus hoaxes than about any individual real virus.\nNote: some links on this page will open in a separate brower window\nVirus hoaxes are false reports about usually non-existent viruses, often claiming to do impossible things. Unfortunately some recipients occasionally believe a hoax to be a true virus warning and may take drastic action (such as shutting down their network) or deleting innocent files from their hard disk.\nTypically such hoaxes circulate by emails, which describe a dangerous new undetectable virus, usually using bogus technical terms. Hoaxes often ask you to avoid reading or downloading emails that have a particular subject line. Examples include Budweiser Frogs, It Takes Guts to Say Jesus, and Join the Crew.\nFor instance, the Good Times hoax claims to put your computer's CPU in \"an nth-complexity infinite binary loop, which can severely damage the processor\". Good thing it doesn't exist. The hoax warns you not to read or download anything with the subject \"Good Times\" because the message is a virus.\nOthers such as the Jdbgmgr.exe hoax rely on the presence of an existing file on people's computers to ensure that the hoax is perpetuated. Those supposedly infected are advised to send emails to everyone in their address book warning them that its likely that you have been infected by a virus that is not detected by Anti-virus systems. This virus supposedly sits quietly on your computer for 14 days before damaging the system. It is sent automatically by 'messenger' and by address book, whether or not you've sent e-mail to your contacts and advises you to search for a file with the name jdbgmgr.exe and which has a teddy bear icon. It advises you to delete the file and then urges you to warn as many people on their address book as possible that they may have been infected through your address book.\nYou are not helping people. The continued re-forwarding of these hoaxes simply wastes time and email bandwidth and could result in your email address being blocked as spam by others. It is also possible that you may receive a hoax via email with a file attached or advising you to download a special program. Obviously, such files should be treated with caution, as they may be viruses, spyware or Trojan programs.\nIn the case of hoaxes such as the Jdbgmgr.exe, the hoax encourages you to delete a legitimate Windows file from your computer. Jdbgmgr.exe is in fact the Microsoft Debugger Registrar for Java. The Jdbgmgr.exe file may be installed when you install Windows and does not do any harm to your system but its presence on your hard disk seeming confirms the \"truth\" of the warning and results in widespread hoax warnings.\nDOT-COMmunications' recommends deleting all virus hoax emails immediately, whether they contain file attachments or not and making sure you have a good anti-virus program installed, constantly updated and ran regularly.\nAlthough no official research has been done on the subject, it is estimated that hoaxes can cost you even more than a genuine virus incident. After all, no anti-virus program will detect hoaxes because they aren't really viruses and no amount of updates or new programs will detect something that doesn't exist. Some people panic when they receive a hoax virus warning - making the situation much worse. The amount of email that a typical hoax can generate is also a cost to organisations. Once a few people in your organisation have received a warning and mailed it to all their friends and colleagues, a mail overload can easily result.\nYour organisation may like to consider circulating a policy on virus hoaxes to your staff and volunteers, in an attempt to reduce the costs involved.\nHere is an example policy you could use:\n\"You shall not forward any virus warnings of any kind to *anyone* inside or outside the organisation other than <insert name of the department or staff member who looks after anti-virus issues or alternatively forward it to viruses@DOT-COMmunications.co.uk>. It doesn't matter if the virus warnings have apparently come from an anti-virus vendor or been confirmed by any large computer company or your best friend. *All* virus warnings should be sent to <insert name>, and <insert name> alone. It is <insert name>'s job to send round all virus warnings, and a virus warning which comes from any other source should be ignored.\"\nKeep yourself informed - you can ensure you have useful, up-to-the-minute data on the latest, \"hottest\" hoaxes with very little effort by visiting our latest virus information page.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Posted December 5, 2012 Atlanta, GA\nStudy finds security indicators sacrificed to accommodate small screens\nATLANTA – Dec. 5, 2012 – How unsafe are mobile browsers? Unsafe enough that even cyber-security experts are unable to detect when their smartphone browsers have landed on potentially dangerous websites, according to a recent Georgia Tech study.\nLike their counterparts for desktop platforms, mobile browsers incorporate a range of security and cryptographic tools to provide a secure Web-browsing experience. However in one critical area that informs user decisions—the incorporation of tiny graphical indicators in a browser’s URL field—all of the leading mobile browsers fail to meet security guidelines recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for browser safety, leaving even expert users with no way to determine if the websites they visit are real or imposter sites phishing for personal data.\n“We found vulnerabilities in all 10 of the mobile browsers we tested, which together account for more than 90 percent of the mobile browsers in use today in the United States,” said Patrick Traynor, assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science. “The basic question we asked was, ‘Does this browser provide enough information for even an information-security expert to determine security standing?’ With all 10 of the leading browsers on the market today, the answer was no.”\nThe graphic icons at issue are called either SSL (“secure sockets layer”) or TLS (“transport layer security”) indicators, and they serve to alert users (a) when their connection to the destination website is secure and (b) that the website they see is actually the site they intended to visit. The tiny “lock” icon that typically appears in a desktop browser window when users are providing payment information in an online transaction is one example of an SSL indicator. Another is the “https” keyword that appears in the beginning of a desktop browser’s URL field.\nThe W3C has issued specific recommendations for how SSL indicators should be built into a browser’s user interface, and for the most part, Traynor said, desktop browsers do a good job of following those recommendations. In mobile browsers, however, the guidelines are followed inconsistently at best and often not at all.\nThe principal reason for this, Traynor admits, is the much smaller screen size with which designers of mobile browsers have to work. Often there simply isn’t room to incorporate SSL indicators in same way as with desktop browsers. However, given that mobile devices are widely predicted to face more frequent attacks from cyber-criminals, the vulnerability is almost sure to lead to increased cyber-crime unless it is addressed.\n“Research has shown that mobile browser users are three times more likely to access phishing sites than users of desktop browsers,” said Chaitrali Amrutkar, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and principal author of the paper that described the SSL research. “Is that all due to the lack of these SSL indicators? Probably not, but giving these tools a consistent and complete presence in mobile browsers would definitely help.”\nThe paper, “Measuring SSL Indicators on Mobile Browsers: Extended Life, or End of the Road,” earned Amrutkar a Best Student Paper award at this year’s Information Security Conference, held Sept. 19-21 in Passau, Germany. Traynor and Amrutkar said the study, essentially a measurement analysis of the current state of visual security indicators in mobile browsers, is a necessary first step in developing a uniform set of security recommendations that can apply to mobile browsers.\n“We understand the dilemma facing designers of mobile browsers, and it looks like all of them tried to do the best they could in balancing everything that has to fit within those small screens,” Traynor said. “But the fact is that all of them ended up doing something just a little different—and all inferior to desktop browsers. With a little coordination, we can do a better job and make mobile browsing a safer experience for all users.”\nAssistant Director of Communications\nCollege of Computing at Georgia Tech", "label": 1}

It’s able to making billions and trillions of computations per second.\nThrough cloud computing, users may be able to perform tasks like analysis of sales data, storing medical information of patients, and estimating business venture risks. Generally, cloud computing includes infrastructure-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, and platform-as-a-service. For an ordinary business, the computing costs are an analogous and the company often absorbs any upfront costs associated with cloud computing.\nThe infrastructure of cloud computing is commonly located off-site and accessible during the internet. It is also provided by a third-part and users should not have to have technological expertise. Lack of control and access in addition to potential security risks are common issues raised against cloud computing. Users, however, experience device and site independence they usually can access different applications through an internet browser using different devices.\nOften, cloud computing is confused with autonomic computing, grid computing, and utility computing although various providers do rely upon grids. It does share some traits with autonomic computing and feature an identical billing methods like those utilized by utilities. These days, these same providers have expanded and people systems available now now not have centralized billing infrastructures or systems . Large business organizations are actually tapping the largest cloud computing services providers for his or her needs.\nCloud computing was in a position to raise awareness towards resource optimization. Business executives are actually looking into savings they’ll generate from support personnel, software licenses, power, and space in the event that they get to the cloud. Initial steps are being undertaken by businesses, which not yet able to bring their computing requirements to the cloud, to pool and consolidated data and computing resources in addition to software efficiency.\nOn-demand, scaling, and automation features often lessen delivery lead-time for services and software to only a couple of minutes which ends to controlled steady-state expenses, diminished time-to-value, and captured runaway demand. Cloud computing is ready to push these business organizations to adopt technological strategies and investment practices in addition to operating models which will balance operating cash flows, capital outlays, control, time, and opportunity.\nCloud computing operating practices and technologies turn support and delivery right into a commodity. It offers a substitute for business executives. Those providers of data technology need to step up their profiles and offerings in order that they get nearest to their suppliers and customers, and business innovation by providing a brand new and higher capability delivery. They should adopt architectural practices, management, and technology strategies so they provide services and products which are easily bundled.\nCloud computing is usually capable of show its effectiveness as regards to software design discipline. It’s totally dependent upon the deployment readiness, quality, and design of its software to ensure that it to supply cost containment, performance, resource optimization, and scalability.\nLastly, cloud computing also paves the best way for the emergence of platforms.

IE users with unpatched systems can be infected by simply looking at a malicious JPEG image.\nSo what does MC have to do with this?\nMembers of MC can put images inside their posts or signature or link to them, even upload them. Avatars are also pictures. We can't deny the possibility that somebody would put up a malicious image, although we hope and believe that none of our users would ever do so. One solution would be to turn off those features, but that would hardly be acceptable. However, this does prompt us to issue a very severe warning:\nIf you haven't done so already, update your computer!\nWindows Update will both update GDI+ and run a small program that determines what other programs on your computer need patching. Install the update, run the program, patch your other programs if necessary and then, if you use Microsoft Office, go to Office Update and install all available patches. Once you've completed these steps, you should be safe. However:\nMYSTcommunity and its staff are in no way responsible for the content posted by its members, including malicious images and other malware.\nAnd one more thing, which should speak for itself but is nonetheless very important:\nAny user found posting such malicious images on MC, linking to them, or referencing them in any other way will automatically be banned. No exceptions, no excuses.\nPage 1 of 1\nWarning about malicious JPEG images Very important information\nShare this topic:\nPage 1 of 1", "label": 1}

{"text": "PHP Security and YOU - Including files the right way\nAs a web host we fight the battle against hackers and bad code on a daily basis. So HostNexus is looking to encourage clients to use file inclusion within PHP in a more security conscious and safe manner.\nIncluding files with PHP is a common practice and most usage comes in 2 forms. These are including internal files from your own domain and including files from remote (external) sources. This looks something like:\nBoth are valid syntax in the PHP world but there are two main problems we see on the servers. Sometimes when you include a file using the the URL of your local domain you can cause a PHP loop that initiates\nendless HTTP requests which causes server load issues and even a server crash due to the load. If you want to include files from your local domain you just need to use the server path instead:\nAnd now onto using include() for calling external files:\nThe main problem with include() is that runs everything through the PHP parser and evaluates code. The main problem comes from setting a variable for include() which can be easily exploited. Here is an example of code in an index.php:\necho \" <body>\\n\";\necho \" </body>\\n\";\nThe $go variable above is easily exploited like:\nThe hacker can now execute commands on your files, installing phishing sites, sending spam and stealing data.\nIf you want to include files from remote domains use PHP's readfile() function instead:\nWhile not 100% secure it still provides more protection as readfile() simply outputs data to a browser rather than parsing everything as PHP.\nI emailed about this issue in a recent NewsFlash and the blog post has been up for quite some time. We will be setting allow_url_include to off on all servers from August 1st so please check your code if you use includes and make the easy changes.\nTha's All Folks!\nSee you all next time.\n- Laurence, Head Coffee Maker, HostNexus", "label": 1}

Using a base transceiver station (available for 1000 euro) he has shown how common programming errors in the communication stack of mobile phones can be exploited to gain control of the devices.\nRalf-Philipp Weinmann found devastating flaws in a large percentage of cellular communication stacks. According to him, sufficiently motivated attackers are able to attack phones in a way that is almost undetectable. Vulnerable cell phones can be taken over if they are within the range of the rogue transceiver, which may mean hundreds of phones at a time in crowded urban areas. Attackers can cause billing problems by either dialing premium numbers or sending text messages to premium services; or they can monitor the complete communications of the cell phone user.\nEavesdropping on nearby cell phones is also possible by making the vulnerable cell phone pick up incoming calls automatically -- without the user noticing.The attacking transceiver needs to be online for just a couple of seconds to perform the attack.\nThe University of Luxembourg, is working together with a number of vendors for both cellular communication chips and mobile phones.

{"text": "...making Linux just a little more fun!\nBy Ray Ingles\n\"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.\" - C.A.R. Hoare\n\"Sure I'm paranoid, but am I paranoid ENOUGH?\" - Unknown\nSystem administrators frequently want to be able to work on the machines they run even when they are far away from them. There are secure tools that allow full remote shell access, like ssh and lsh, but due to their complexity they have suffered critical exploits from time to time. In addition, their overhead can be excessive for some purposes. Fortunately, other options are available that can be used alone or can be combined with remote shells to create a more secure overall system.\nMaybe the pager has just gone off when you're home in bed, and the boss wants you to fix the broken database now. Or perhaps you're out for lunch and someone calls to tell you the mailserver has been cracked and is currently spamming the world, and you need to bring it down fast. Possibly you've checked and your Web server has wedged itself and needs to be restarted. Or suppose you're just on vacation and find you want to update your home Web site with some new photos. In all these cases, you'd like to do something to the machine over the Internet without having to actually sit in front of it - things you don't want just anybody to be able to do.\nTools like ssh and lsh are great for allowing secure remote access to your system. They offer essentially full, flexible remote control of a machine, in an encrypted and authenticated manner. But they are complex pieces of software; there's no way to do what they do without being complex. And with complexity comes bugs. SSH and lsh, and related tools like Webmin, have all had serious flaws that would allow an attacker to get full control over your system. Leaving them available all the time is a risk - sometimes it's necessary, but it's still a risk. And in some cases, you'd like to be able to tell the machine to do something, but it's not even attached to the network on a regular basis.\nIt would be nice to enable remote shell access only when necessary. And perhaps (for something like shutting down a mail server) you don't even need a full shell, just a way to fire off a script remotely. Of course, the problem then becomes, how do you know that the alternative software is any more secure than ssh itself? Various people have worked on this problem in the past, and several potential solutions are available, ranging from the simple and venerable to the new and exotic.\nXringd uses a modem to control a machine remotely. Mail filters can be used to trigger actions based on special messages. Some solutions (like 'port knocking' and 'Net::Pcap') use the network, but without requiring even a single open port. Lando runs commands over a network, using username and password. Most recently, a program specifically for secure remote execution called Ostiary has been developed.\nThe eXtended Ring Daemon, or \"Xringd\", uses a modem to monitor rings on a phone line. It counts the number of rings, and the time between them. If a 'sequence' matches one of the ones that it has been set up to detect, Xringd will run an associated command.\nThis is very nice from a security perspective. Since it uses no network connection at all, it's entirely immune to network attacks like buffer overflows. It can be used even when a network connection is unavailable (it's often used to cause a computer to initiate a dialup connection). The only 'client' you need is a phone. If you use it to start up ssh on demand, then the attacker needs to know the right phone number and the right ring pattern - it's quite hard to sniff that kind of thing remotely. It's also highly resistant to a man in the middle attack. (If you have to worry about someone rerouting your phone calls, you're in more trouble than Xringd can save you from.)\nThere are some practical issues that may make this unattractive in some circumstances. You need a modem and a telephone line to the server. (Fortunately, you don't need a fast modem at all; even a 1200 baud one will do nicely, but some servers are not placed close to a telephone jack.) Also, things like answering machines or voicemail (or even other people answering the telephone) can interfere with Xringd. If you give the server a dedicated line, you can avoid these problems, but that can be costly.\nFinally, note that the rings you hear when making a call are not necessarily synchronized with the ring signals actually sent to the telephone. In most circumstances, they are close enough, but reliability can be an issue at times.\nMost of the mail filtering programs have a way to invoke scripts when mail matching a pattern is received (in the simplest case, mail to a particular address). Assuming the server is running an SMTP daemon, this can be a nice way of triggering actions remotely. Technically, one could even send a shell script to be run, and have it e-mail the results back to you, giving you the equivalent of a very slow remote shell. The only client needed is an e-mail program, or even a webmail account.\nThe first problem is that if the box you want to talk to doesn't accept e-mail, this obviously won't work. (Adding an entire mail server, with the attendant risks of bugs, spam load, etc., just for remote execution doesn't make a lot of sense.) Some machines only periodically collect e-mail from a primary server, so there can be a substantial delay between when a command is sent and when it is acted upon.\nFurthermore, if you don't encrypt the traffic in some way (or at least sign it with PGP), then anyone sniffing traffic between you and your server may be able to take advantage of the same channel to do mischief, or perform a man-in-the-middle-attack. (E-mail traffic is notoriously easy to falsify; hence the avalanche of spam these days.)\nCVTSA, or \"ClairVoyanT SysAdmin\", is a system designed specifically for running commands through e-mail. It has some support for using passwords, but does not (currently) encrypt them in transit, so a sniffer could capture them and use them again.\nOf course, if the only things you want to do with this type of system are emergency shutdowns and other such (hopefully rare) crisis management, then even an unencrypted channel might work. However, you'll need to change the 'magic trigger pattern' each time after you use it, or you take the risk that an attacker might capture it and 'replay' it at an inconvenient time.\nWith port knocking, a daemon monitors firewall logs, looking for particular sequences of connection attempts to particular (closed) ports. When it sees a sequence it recognizes, it runs the associated command. This isn't terribly bandwidth efficient, but it has some nice properties. First, it's hard to tell if a server is listening for port knocks. Second (and most important), it's awfully hard to crack a closed port. (Linksys routers have had a simple version of this for a while, BTW, that they call port triggering.)\nHowever, a clever attacker with a sniffer could notice this traffic, and duplicate it for their own use. More complicated encodings could express something like a PGP signature (indeed, in theory one could create an entire network protocol based on port knocks), but things rapidly become difficult to work with. As with 'mail filtering' solutions, one can either use it sparingly in emergencies, or move to real cryptography.\nIt's also important to realize that this system is critically dependent on the probe packets actually being delivered, and delivered in the order that they were sent. This is not guaranteed on the Internet. What's more, depending on where you're at (e.g., an Internet cafe or behind a business firewall), you might not be allowed to connect out to arbitrary ports. The more complex you make the 'knocks', the less reliable the system will be.\nAlso, notice that at least one entire IP packet (28 bytes or so minimum) is used to transmit roughly one bit of information. In terms of network efficiency, it's almost hideous. For a simple 'open up ssh' message, it's not a consideration, but actually adding cryptographic security to this system could use up a decent chunk of the available bandwidth.\nFinally, this increases the CPU load for each entry in the firewall log. Depending on how detailed the logs are, and how fast and busy the network is, this can be a significant drain on resources.\nAnother interesting approach is to use Net::Pcap or other network capturing software to look for specific packets on the network (e.g., DNS requests) and examine them for particular data (e.g., a particular address). If found, it can enable ssh temporarily, or perform other actions.\nOne potential benefit of this approach is that a computer doesn't have to have an address on a network in order to monitor traffic on that network. You can set the card to 'promiscuous mode' and examine all the traffic on the wire. (It's very hard to hack a machine you don't even know is there.) Once the 'trigger' is spotted, the sniffer can use other means (a separate network, a serial link, even Xringd) to open up SSH on a target machine. Of course, you can also simply run the sniffer directly on the target.\nAgain, a clever attacker with their own sniffer may be able to detect the unusual activity and correlate it. To make this system truly secure, you would need more complex encoding/encryption of the 'trigger' traffic.\nAdditionally, the CPU load for this solution can be even worse than for 'port knocking' systems. A 'port knocking' daemon monitors firewall logs, which can have variable levels of detail. By necessity, a 'sniffer' solution must examine every packet on the network segment, which can be a substantial task for a busy gigabit line.\nLando allows a user to run a preconfigured set of commands remotely, using passwords, and even allowing the user to supply arguments to them. While it currently has only a Windows client, and passwords are sent in the clear (making it suitable only for use on a trusted local network, or perhaps on a VPN), it can be very useful for, e.g. operating a local firewall box without going to the trouble of logging in.\nAll of the above solutions have their advantages, but each has some practical issues that can make them unsuitable for particular applications. Ostiary was designed to be a secure alternative that uses minimal resources. It tackles this problem with what might be termed \"aggressive simplicity\". It does require an active connection to the network (unlike Xringd and sniffing), but allows for much better default security with very low CPU, RAM, disk, and network bandwidth requirements.\nAn Ostiary server has one open port that it listens on. When someone connects, the server sends a random fixed length 'salt' message 16 bytes in size - the size of an MD5 hash. It then waits (with a timeout) for a reply from the client. It reads (at most) 16 bytes of reply, and closes the connection.\nOstiary has a list of commands to run, with associated passwords. It runs through the list, and hashes these passwords with the 'salt' it sent to the client. If one of these hashes matches the reply from the client, the associated command is run. (One final touch is that a record is kept of connections, and clients with too many failed attempts are 'locked out', and all subsequent communication from them is ignored.)\nA detailed security analysis is available, but a few things about this system should be clear. With a protocol this simple, the chances for dangerous bugs are drastically reduced. Using fixed-length messages essentially eliminates the chances of a buffer overflow or other memory error. (Indeed, Ostiary does no dynamic memory allocation of any kind - everything is stored in static, fixed-size data structures.) Replay and man-in-the-middle attacks are also effectively useless. Ostiary limits how fast it accepts connections, enforcing low CPU and network usage. (The first production Ostiary server was a 16MHz 68030 machine.) Client requirements are even lower: Clients are available for Palm Pilots and even Windows.\nUnlike a procmail-based solution, where you can put arbitrary commands (with arguments) in the message, Ostiary can only run the fixed set of commands you have preconfigured. The only argument it supplies to the commands is the IP address of the client that initiated the command. It requires an active network connection (unlike Xringd) and an open port (unlike port knocking or sniffing), which may entail configuring a firewall to open a new port. (Although one could run Ostiary on, say, port 22, and upon receipt of the correct command, it could terminate itself and spawn sshd...)\nSince Ostiary uses TCP, it is as reliable as the network it uses to communicate. Problems with miscounted phone rings (a la Xringd) or randomly dropped packets (a la port knocking) are not a concern.\nThe following table summarizes the pros and cons of the various systems outlined above. \"Replay\" and \"Man-in-the-middle\" indicate if the default system is vulnerable to the corresponding attacks. \"Command arguments\" indicates if the system can run arbitrary commands with arguments. \"CPU load\" indicates that CPU time can be a significant consideration. \"Special client\" indicates that a specific client program is needed to work with that system.\n|System||Xringd||Mail filter||Port knocking||Sniffers||Lando||Ostiary|\nNone of these approaches is right for everyone. But all of them can be used to make attacks at least more inconvenient, and in many cases far more difficult. Remember, though, to analyze their pros and cons relative to your specific situation. Also remember that true security is a process, not a goal - you can never just install some software and be done thinking about it.\nRay Ingles has been involved with Linux since 1995.

{"text": "20 June 2012 by Pelle Neroth\nAnother example: Two years ago cyber thieves stole 30 million euros' worth of carbon allowances from the European carbon trading exchange, forcing trading to cease for some days on order of the European Commission. A third recent incident: the social and business networking website LinkedIn had six million user passwords leaked online after users were targeted by fake emails asking them to confirm their login details in a so called \"phishing attack\" by hackers.\nCyber crime is a broad church, including denial of service attacks, attacks on critical infrastructures (like the Stuxnet worm), botnets which marshal thousands of innocent owners' computers to do cyber criminals' work, malware, online frauds, and child pornography picture trading. It is a costly problem - £27bn a year just in the UK, according to a 2011 Home Office study and it is growing threat as more and more services like taxes and benefits payments migrate online.\nIt is also under reported. A lot of scams affect millions of individuals but only small sums per individual, so many feel it's not worth going to the police about. And companies have their own reasons. Their incentives are misaligned. They are unwilling to disclose problems for fear of losing customers as their reputations would take a hit for being insecure. Many do short term fixes on their systems and price fraud into their business model. And keep very quiet about breaches.\nLaw enforcement agencies are arguably understaffed, though the situation is getting better. Europol, the EU policing agency, has just 7 out of 457 staff dealing with cybercrime from its shiny new offices in the Hague, according to a Commission-funded report. CEPOL, the UK based European police college, does not have cybercrime experts among its 42 staff.\nLaw enforcement agencies are put off by jurisdictional failures from covering crimes of an essentially global and dispersed nature. Communicating by instant messenger or through bulletin boards websites, malware writers, malware distributors, and credit card abusers are all different people who may never meet and are located in different countries. Clear up rates are low.\nA dozen EU countries have separately adopted national cybercrime strategies, among them the UK. The cybercrime unit will be an important part of the new National Crime Agency launching next year, according to the UK's \"Mr Cyber\", cabinet office minister Francis Maude. But cybercrime is one of those areas crying out for international coordination and several initiatives are afoot. NATO is developing its own strategy, and has its own cyber warfare centre in Tallinn, Estonia. The EU itself at the end of May agreed to set up a cybercrime centre (ECCC) at Europol, consisting of 55 persons that will help coordinate national efforts. The European Commission will also be proposing new legislation in the third quarter of 2012 making notification of security breaches compulsory for companies in the energy, transport, banking and financial sectors. The requirement to report could worsen the reputational damage to companies that have experienced security breaches. So rather than do that they will spend more on security to lower their vulnerability, officials say. Telecoms and internet firms are already subject to reporting obligations.\nYou have to ask whether the ECCC is an effective solution, though. According to the Commission's own estimates, 8 trillion dollars a year changes hands through e-commerce. The Commission-funded feasibility study* proposes a three million euro budget for the ECCC for its first year of operation. That is not a lot when you look at the science prizes of up to one billion the EU is handing out for basic research projects - or compared to the $57bn budget for the US Department of Homeland Security.\nPelle Neroth -- EU correspondent\nPosted By: Pelle Neroth @ 20 June 2012 08:28 AM Brussels\nFuseTalk Standard Edition - © 1999-2013 FuseTalk Inc.

{"text": "Whatever its origin, the Stuxnet worm provided something that few publicly-debated online incidents have offered to date.\nFor at least 15 years, security experts have warned that cyber attacks would one day strike at “critical infrastructure” – whether it’s power grids, energy supply, air traffic control (in the more extreme imagination of Richard Clarke, at least), emergency services and so on.\nReal-world incidents have been limited, however: most countries have no single electricity “off-switch” accessible from the Internet, for example. In attacking SCADA software, Stuxnet has acted as a proof-of-concept for something rarely seen in the wild. Arguably, it also demonstrated that environments like SCADA systems are, to date, not typically Internet-connected: its medium of infection was USB keys.\nBut in a world that’s probably growing weary of the jump-at-shadows mindset of IT security journalism, Stuxnet wasn’t a shadow but a real event.\nDr Prescott Winter, former director and CIO of the US National Security Agency and now CTO (Public Sector) for security vendor ArcSight, argues that it’s time for governments to take a more active role in finding ways to secure the Internet.\nSpeaking to journalists in Sydney in early October as part of an ArcSight national roadshow, Dr Winter said that while private industry (particularly in America) might chafe at government intervention and regulation of the online world, it’s as inevitable as regulation of air traffic became in the 20th century.\nThe prime manifestation of the problem, Dr Winter said, is the ongoing problem of the “botnet”. Individuals at home aren’t protected, he told the roadshow; their computers become incubation grounds for botnets.\n“Some kind of protective process to clean that up is absolutely essential,” he said.\n“There are botnets residing in millions of home computers around the world, and those can be turned-on ‘like that’.”\nToday’s “scattershot” approach to the botnet problem isn’t enough protection, he said: “we have bans on aircraft ... bans on ‘bad packets’ is an area governments need to work on.”\nAnd that in itself is a challenge. The “bad packet” problem is international – and around the world, the relationship between the government and the private sector changes from country to country.\nDr Winter said America may not even be the best country to take the lead in protecting Internet users, because of its historical gulf between government and the private sector. As a result, an effort like the IIA’s Internet code of practice is “almost unimaginable in the US.\n“I think this case in Australia is going to be very interesting to watch. It seems to have come about with a group of the leading ISPs and service providers coming together to design this solution.\n“There are a lot of things it doesn’t have in it yet – but as an initial outline for a policy framework to clean up ... the Australian part of the Internet, it is certainly a commendable start. Eventually, you probably want to make sure that you have all your service providers involved.”\nWorms and the Real World\nGiven that “physical attacks” – damage to infrastructure, attacks on emergency services and the like – hold such a high profile in the popular mind, it’s interesting that Dr Winter nominated attacks against intellectual property as today’s leading concern.\nOne reason, he said, is that “some action has been taking in protecting the critical systems ... for example, the FAA is getting a complete rebuild from the ground up.”\nThe shift in emphasis “from catastrophic failure to IP”, Dr Winter said, is because “the steady drain of intellectual property out of the leading technical nations of the world is a major cause for concern.\nThe investment in developing products and services, he said, is in danger of “leaking” to countries like China, but “IP protection and the integrity of the supply chain are currently lower on most peoples’ threat radar than a catastrophic cyber ‘Pearl Harbour’”.\nSecurity, software and the Cloud\nSecurity would seem to provide a great marketing entree for cloud providers: if everything the home user needs can be hosted by a cloud provider, the user’s exposure to threats could fall dramatically.\nHowever, it’s not playing out that way.\n“I don’t think there’s as much progress as any of us would like to see ... we have had some discussions with people at Microsoft about trust models you can begin to build into the Internet.”\n“App store” markets are another area Dr Winter would like to see paying more attention to security, since users place an implicit trust in the integrity of the software they download from an app store.\nThat, however, leads to the vexed question of software quality. If cloud providers and app sellers are expected to warrant that their software is secure, shouldn’t a similar requirement apply to the whole software industry, which typically escapes liability with disclaimers?\nYes: “The software industry has gotten away with murder on this point forever,” Dr Winter said. “Deploy, then fix, is the old habit of the software industry, and that model isn’t viable in the cloud.”\nHe said software quality processes need to be put into place industry-wide (and world-wide), and this will represent a culture-shock for the software industry.", "label": 1}

Contrary to what the name might imply, Rainbow tables are an extreamly powerful and useful tool in the computer world, and they are alot less complicated then you may think.\nWhat are they?\n(accoarding to Wikipedia)\nA rainbow table is a lookup table offering a time-memory tradeoff used in recovering the plaintext password from a password hash generated by a hash function, often a cryptographic hash function. A common application is to make attacks against hashed passwords feasible. Salt is often employed with hashed passwords to avoid this attack.\n(In English More Less)\nRainbow tables use a refined algorithm by using a number of different reduction functions to create multiple parallel chains within a single “rainbow” table, reducing the probability of false positives from accidental chain collisions, and thus increasing the probability of a correct password crack. As well as increasing the probability of a correct crack for a given table size, the use of multiple reduction functions also greatly increases the speed of lookups. See the paper cited below for details.\nRainbow tables are specific to the hash function they were created for e.g., MD5 tables can crack only MD5 hashes. The theory of this technique was first pioneered by Philippe Oechslin  as a fast form of time-memory tradeoff  (PDF), which he implemented in the Windows password cracker Ophcrack. The more powerful RainbowCrack program was later developed that can generate and use rainbow tables for a variety of character sets and hashing algorithms, including LM hash, MD5, SHA1, etc.\nWhat that all means isssss???\nThey allow you to hack the shit out of things If theres a password you need, or an account name to something, you can use Rainbow Tables to “recover” them.

Not many people know they even exsist.\n2) They are fairly complicated as first look, but have a HUGE community backing them up.\n3) They are massive in size. A shitty set of tables runs at about 8 Gigabytes, and would prove very in-effective for most uses. If you wanted to “crack” serious things, you’d need a set running about 120 Gigabytes in size. Currently they are working on a set that are approx. 420 Gigabytes in size. So basically, unless you want to wait 6 months for download your out of luck with getting them.\n(However some programs are offered where they will ship them to you on a hard drive the download)", "label": 1}
{"text": "Web users are getting anxious about their personal data being collected by search engines for targeted advertising, according to a recent report released by the Pew Internet.\nThe Pew Internet & American Life survey showed that 65 percent of Internet users feel that it’s a bad thing if a search engine is collecting information about their searches and then using it to rank future search results, as it would limit information users get online and what search results they see.\n73 percent of the respondents said that they would not be OK with a search engine keeping track of searches and personalizing future search results, as it would be an invasion of their privacy.\nOnly 29% of those surveyed said that it’s a good thing that search engines collect information about the searches and use it to rank future search results, because it gives users results that are more relevant to them, while 23% said that they are Ok with search engines keeping track of their searches and using that information to personalize their future search results, even if it means they are gathering information about them.\nMost of the users are not aware of the ways they can limit the information that websites gather about them. Only 38% of Internet users said that they knew of things they could do to limit personal information. Among this group, one common strategy people used to limit personal data collection was to delete their web history.\nDespite these concerns about online privacy, the Pew research found that users’ overall views of search engine performance is positive. Use of search engine is still one of the most popular online activities, rivaled only by email. Users expressed high levels of confidence in the capabilities of search engines, with 91% stating that they always or most of the time find the information they are seeking, and 73% stating that most or all the information they find using search engines is accurate and trustworthy.\nAs expected, Google topped the list of most popular search engines, with 83 percent of stating that they used Google to carry out most of their searches.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Recently 4800 plus credit cards of Saudi Arabia were hacked by Israeli Hackers and after that they put all information about these cards on internet too. So internet is not a safe place unless you take some security measures in order to protect computer from malicious attacks. Computer experts says that if you connect new computer to the internet than this new computer will be effected by viruses with few minutes. That’s unsafe internet is, so its important that you first secure your computer and than connect it with internet otherwise you will be in the hands of some hacker.\n1. Install an Antivirus Software\nAntivirus software is the first line of defense for any computer out there on internet and without it your are take very big risk of your precious data and files. Although Windows operating system are getting much and much secure after time but hackers can still find security loop holes in your system and can take it down. There are mainly two types of antivirus software’s available on internet free and paid. Both works well but premium software allows to update and use more advanced features which are not available in the free version.\nThe first thing you should do is to install a free Norton antivirus software but if you cannot afford to buy antivirus software than you can also use free Norton Internet security 2012 giveaway and get your free key. The way is works is very simple, companies want to promote there software and hence give some free product keys to the websites which review their products. These blogs than gives software’s to general public via giveaways in which you can easily participate. After you get your antivirus software, install it and update its virus definitions in order to maximizes its protection ability.\n2. Change and Update you Browser\nUnfortunately the most reliable browser of last century is the most UN-reliable browser of 21st century. I am talking about Microsoft Internet Explorer. I don’t know why Microsoft is not taking it seriously and they are far behind from other internet browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.So if you are one of those who are still using Microsoft Internet explorer than my friend your laptop can any time get hacked or infected by viruses.\nIf you are using browser other than Microsoft Internet Explorer than its essential that you upgrade your browser when ever a new update is available. Generally Mozilla Firefox Nightly updates are released every month so its better to check manually or set your browser settings to auto so that it can automatically checks and updates your browsers. Now a days browsers plugins and extensions are very popular among young guys but let me tell you that these extensions can inject some malicious code into your browser so its better to not use these plugins.\n3. Use Firewall Program\nJust installing antivirus software is not enough in order to make your system 100 percent secure. Now a days any antivirus programs are equipped with firewalls but unfortunately these are not good for your system. Try to use third part firewalls as these are created by professional and they will also provide you full customer support.\nFirewall is another option which will make sure that only the request generated by your system will enter in your computer. When ever you want to visit some website your computer sent signals to the out side world. Now of course these signals have to cross whole world and than return to your computer but the problem is that any one can see you computer on the internet and send requests to enter into your system.\nRequests generated by outsiders will totally be rejected. This way you can easily block hackers attacks. Although windows 7 firewall is very good but in addition to that you can also install ZoneAlarm, GFI etc.\n4. Try to Avoid Adobe Flash Player and Acrobat Reader\nYou may be wondering what is this. These are the most used applications on internet and why they are not safe. Yes but this is the problem with these applications. There popularity makes them ideal for hackers to target and hence find security loop holes in it. Adobe Flash is so unreliable that Apple has not chosen to add support for this application in there gadgets.\nNow i know you are saying that without these software your work can be effected so let me tell you some alternatives that can help you. You can use HTML5 instead of Flash which worlds perfectly fine and recently YouTube is also experimenting with HTML5 in their videos. If this project will be successful than they will also adapt this technology. For acrobat files you can use another free alternative and that is Google chrome browser. Not many people know that Chrome can also open and read Acrobat files so go and install it now if you don’t have it.\n5. Stay away from Malware Websites\nOne of the main reason that your computer or laptop is effected by some virus or malicious software’s is that you have visited some bad URL or website that redirects to some malicious website. These websites consists of websites which give illegal keys and breaks software’s codes to use into your system. But as you may know that they are genius people so they will also do some trick with you and inject some code int you browser. I am using browser again and again because its the front line application that interact with out side world.\nAlso stay away from websites which will promise you to make you millionaire over night or give you money. You can imagine that if some body is offering you free money than why not he is taking this money and become rich. So please stay away from these stupid schemes. You can also use free Anit Malware software to detect these websites.\nLast but not least never accept files by outsiders while chatting, via Email or some other source. Always update your all software’s including antivirus, programs you use or internet browsers.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The current version of Apache is 1.3.9. The main Apache site is at http://www.apache.org/. Another good source of information is Apacheweek at http://www.apacheweek.com/. The Apache documentation is ok, so I'm not going to go into detail in setting up apache. The documentation is on the website and is included with the source (in HTML format). There are also text files included with the source, but the HTML version is better. The documentation should get a whole lot better once the Apache Documentation Project gets under way. Right now most of the documents are written by the developers. Not to discredit the developers, but they are a little hard to understand if you don't know the terminology.\nApache is included in the Red Hat, Slackware, and OpenLinux distributions. Although they may not be the latest version, they are very reliable binaries. The bad news is you will have to live with their directory choices (which are totally different from each other and the Apache defaults).\nThe source is available from the Apache web site at http://www.apache.org/dist/ Binaries are are also available at apache at the same place. You can also get binaries from sunsite at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/www/servers/. And for those of us running Red Hat the latest binary RPM file can usually be found in the contrib directory at ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386/\nIf your server is going to be used for commercial purposes, it is highly recommended that you get the source from the Apache website and compile it yourself. The other option is to use a binary that comes with a major distribution. For example Slackware, Red Hat, or OpenLinux distributions. The main reason for this is security. An unknown binary could have a back door for hackers, or an unstable patch that could crash your system. This also gives you more control over what modules are compiled in, and allows you to set the default directories. It's not that difficult to compile Apache, and besides you not a real Linux user until you compile your own programs ;)\nFirst untar the archive to a temporary directory. Next change to the src\ndirectory. Then edit the Configuration file if you want to include any special\nmodules. The most\ncommonly used modules are already included. There is no need to change the\nrules or makefile stuff for Linux. Next run the Configure shell script\n./Configure). Make sure it says Linux platform and gcc as the compiler.\nNext you may want to edit the httpd.h file to change the default directories.\nThe server home (where the config files are kept) default is\n/usr/local/etc/httpd/, but you may want to change\nit to just\n/etc/httpd/. And the server root (where the HTML pages are\nserved from) default is\n/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/, but I like the directory\nRed Hat default for Apache). If you are going to be using su-exec (see\nspecial features below) you\nmay want to change that directory too. The server root can also be changed from the\nconfig files too. But it is also good to compile it in, just encase Apache\ncan't find or read the config file. Everything else should be changed\nfrom the config files.\nFinally run make to compile Apache.\nIf you run in to problems with include files missing, check the following things. Make sure you have the kernel headers (include files) installed for your kernel version. Also make sure you have these symbolic links in place:\nLinks can be made with\n/usr/include/linux should be a link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/asm should be a link to /usr/src/linux/include/asm /usr/src/linux should be a link to the Linux source directory (ex.linux-2.0.30)\nln -s, it works just like the cp command except it makes a link (\nln -s source-dir destination-link)\nWhen make is finished there should be an executable named httpd in the\ndirectory. This needs to be moved in to a bin directory.\n/usr/local/sbin would be good choices.\nCopy the conf, logs, and icons sub-directories from the source to the server\nhome directory. Next rename 3 of the files files in the conf sub-directory\nto get rid of the\n-dist extension (ex.\nThere are also several support programs that are included with Apache. They\nare in the\nsupport directory and must be compiled and installed separately.\nMost of them can be make by using the makefile in that directory (which is\nmade when you run the main\nConfigure script). You don't need any of them to\nrun Apache, but some of them make the administrators job easier.\nNow you should have four files in your\nconf sub-directory (under\nyour server home directory). The\nhttpd.conf sets up the server daemon (port\nnumber, user, etc). The\nsrm.conf sets the root document tree, special\nhandlers, etc. The\naccess.conf sets the base case for access. Finally\nmime.types tells the server what mime type to send to the browser for each\nThe configuration files are pretty much self-documented (plenty of comments), as long as you understand the lingo. You should read through them thoroughly before putting your server to work. Each configuration item is covered in the Apache documentation.\nmime.types file is not really a configuration file. It is used by the\nserver to translate file extensions into mime-types to send to the browser.\nMost of the common mime-types are already in the file. Most people should\nnot need to edit this file. As time goes on, more mime types will be added\nto support new programs. The best thing to do is get a new mime-types file\n(and maybe a new version of the server) at that time.\nAlways remember when you change the configuration files you need to restart\nApache or send it the SIGHUP signal with\nkill for the changes to take\neffect. Make sure you send the signal to the parent process and not any of\nthe child processes. The parent usually has the lowest process id number. The\nprocess id of the parent is also in the\nhttpd.pid file in the log\ndirectory. If you accidently send it to one of the child processes the\nchild will die and the parent will restart it.\nI will not be walking you through the steps of configuring Apache. Instead I will deal with specific issues, choices to be made, and special features.\nI highly recommend that all users read through the security tips in the Apache documentation. It is also available from the Apache website at http://www.apache.org/docs/mics/security_tips.html.\nVirtual Hosting is when one computer has more than one domain name. The old way was to have each virtual host have its own IP address. The new way uses only one IP address, but it doesn't work correctly with browsers that don't support HTTP 1.1.\nMy recommendation for businesses is to go with the IP based virtual hosting until most people have browsers that support HTTP 1.1 (give it a year or two). This also gives you a more complete illusion of virtual hosting. While both methods can give you virtual mail capabilities (can someone confirm this?), only IP based virtual hosting can also give you virtual FTP as well.\nIf it is for a club or personal page, you may want to consider shared IP virtual hosting. It should be cheaper than IP based hosting and you will be saving precious IP addresses.\nYou can also mix and match IP and shared IP virtual hosts on the same server. For more information on virtual hosting visit Apacheweek at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/vhost.\nIn this method each virtual host has its own IP address. By determining the IP address that the request was sent to, Apache and other programs can tell what domain to serve. This is an incredible waste of IP space. Take for example the servers where my virtual domain is kept. They have over 35,000 virtual accounts, that means 35,000 IP addresses. Yet I believe at last count they had less than 50 servers running.\nSetting this up is a two part process. The first is getting Linux setup to accept more than one IP address. The second is setting up apache to serve the virtual hosts.\nThe first step in setting up Linux to accept multiple IP addresses is to make a new kernel. This works best with a 2.0 series kernel (or higher). You need to include IP networking and IP aliasing support. If you need help with compiling the kernel see the kernel howto.\nNext you need to setup each interface at boot. If you are using the Red Hat Distribution then this can be done from the control panel. Start X-windows as root, you should see a control panel. Then double click on network configuration. Next goto the interfaces panel and select your network card. Then click alias at the bottom of the screen. Fill in the information and click done. This will need to be done for each virtual host/IP address.\nIf you are using other distributions you may have to do it manually.\nYou can just put the commands in the\nrc.local file in\n/etc/rc.d (really they should go in with the networking\nstuff). You need to have a\nroute command for each device. The\naliased addresses are given a sub device of the main one. For example eth0\nwould have aliases eth0:0, eth0:1, eth0:2, etc. Here is an example of\nconfiguring a aliased device:\nYou can also add a broadcast address and a netmask to the ifconfig command. If you have alot of aliases you may want to make a for loop to make it easier. For more information see the IP alias mini howto.\nifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.57 route add -host 192.168.1.57 dev eth0:0\nThen you need to setup your domain name server (DNS) to serve these new domains. And if you don't already own the domain names, you need to contact the Internic to register the domain names. See the DNS-howto for information on setting up your DNS.\nFinally you need to setup Apache to server the virtual domain correctly.\nThis is in the\nhttpd.conf configuration file near the end. They give you an\nexample to go by. All commands specific to that virtual host are put in\nvirtualhost directive tags. You can put almost any command in there.\nUsually you set up a different document root, script directory, and log\nfiles. You can have almost unlimited number of virtual hosts by adding\nvirtualhost directive tags.\nIn rare cases you may need to run separate servers if a directive is needed for a virtual host, but is not allowed in the virtual host tags. This is done using the bindaddress directive. Each server will have a different name and setup files. Each server only responds to one IP address, specified by the bindaddress directive. This is an incredible waste of system resources.\nThis is a new way to do virtual hosting. It uses a single IP address, thus conserving IP addresses for real machines (not virtual ones). In the same example used above those 30,000 virtual hosts would only take 50 IP addresses (one for each machine). This is done by using the new HTTP 1.1 protocol. The browser tells the server which site it wants when it sends the request. The problem is browsers that don't support HTTP 1.1 will get the servers main page, which could be setup to provide a menu of virtual hosts available. That ruins the whole illusion of virtual hosting. The illusion that you have your own server.\nThe setup is much simpler than the IP based virtual hosting. You still need to get your domain from the Internic and setup your DNS. This time the DNS points to the same IP address as the original domain. Then Apache is setup the same as before. Since you are using the same IP address in the virtualhost tags, it knows you want Shared IP virtual hosting.\nThere are several work arounds for older browsers. I'll explain the best\none. First you need to make your main pages a virtual host (either IP based\nor shared IP). This\nfrees up the main page for a link list to all your virtual hosts. Next you\nneed to make a back door for the old browsers to get in. This is done using\nServerPath directive for each virtual host inside the\ndirective. For example by adding\nServerPath /mysite/ to www.mysite.com old\nbrowsers would be able to access the site by www.mysite.com/mysite/. Then\nyou put the default page on the main server that politely tells them to get\na new browser, and lists links to all the back doors of all the sites you\nhost on that machine. When an old browser accesses the site they will be\nsent to the main page, and get a link to the correct page. New browsers\nwill never see the main page and will go directly to the virtual hosts. You\nmust remember to keep all of your links relative within the web sites,\nbecause the pages will be accessed from two different URL's (www.mysite.com\nI hope I didn't lose you there, but its not an easy workaround. Maybe you should consider IP based hosting after all. A very similar workaround is also explained on the apache website at http://www.apache.org/manual/host.html.\nIf anyone has a great resource for Shared IP hosting, I would like to know about it. It would be nice to know what percent of browsers out there support HTTP 1.1, and to have a list of which browsers and versions support HTTP 1.1.\nThere are two different ways to give your users CGI script capability. The\nfirst is make everything ending in\n.cgi a CGI script. The second is to make\nscript directories (usually named\ncould also use both methods. For either method to work the scripts must be\nworld executable (\nchmod 711). By giving your users script\naccess you are creating a big security risk. Be sure to do your homework to\nminimize the security risk.\nI prefer the first method, especially for complex scripting. It allows you\nto put scripts in any directory. I like to put my scripts with the web pages\nthey work with. For sites with allot of scripts it looks much better than\nhaving a directory full\nof scripts. This is simple to setup. First uncomment the\nat the end of the\nsrm.conf file. Then make sure all your directories have\noption ExecCGI or\nAll in the\nMaking script directories is considered more secure.\nTo make a script directory you use the ScriptAlias directive in the\nsrm.conf file. The first argument is the Alias the second is the actual\ndirectory. For example\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/httpd/cgi-bin/ would make\n/usr/httpd/cgi-bin able to execute scripts. That directory would be used\nwhenever someone asked for the directory\n/cgi-bin/. For security reasons\nyou should also change\nthe properties of the directory to\nOptions none, AllowOveride none in the\naccess.conf (just uncomment the example that is there). Also do not make\nyour script directories subdirectories of your web page directories.\nFor example if you are serving pages from\n/home/httpd/html/, don't make the\n/home/httpd/html/cgi-bin; Instead make it\nIf you want your users to have there own script directories you can use\nScriptAlias commands. Virtual hosts should have there\nScriptAlias command inside the\nvirtualhost directive tags.\nDoes anyone know a simple way to allow\nall users to have a cgi-bin directory without individual ScriptAlias\nThere are two different ways to handle user web directories. The first is to\nhave a subdirectory under the users home directory (usually\nThe second is to have an entirely different directory tree for web directories.\nWith both methods make sure set the access options for these directories\nThe first method is already setup in apache by default. Whenever a request\n/~bob/ comes in it looks for the\npublic_html directory in bob's\nhome directory. You can change the directory with the\nUserDir directive in\nsrm.conf file. This directory must be world readable and executable.\nThis method creates a security risk because for Apache to\naccess the directory the users home directory must be world executable.\nThe second method is easy to setup. You just need to change the\nUserDir directive in the\nsrm.conf file. It has many\ndifferent formats; you may want\nto consult the Apache documentation for clarification. If you want each\nuser to have their own directory under\n/home/httpd/, you would use\nUserDir /home/httpd. Then when the request\n/~bob/ comes in it would translate to\n/home/httpd/bob/. Or if you want to have a subdirectory under bob's\ndirectory you would use\nUserDir /home/httpd/*/html. This would translate to\n/home/httpd/bob/html/ and would allow you to have a script directory\ntoo (for example\nThere are two ways that apache can be run. One is as a daemon that is always running (Apache calls this standalone). The second is from the inetd super-server.\nDaemon mode is far superior to inetd mode. Apache is setup for daemon mode by default. The only reason to use the inetd mode is for very low use applications. Such as internal testing of scripts, small company Intranet, etc. Inetd mode will save memory because apache will be loaded as needed. Only the inetd daemon will remain in memory.\nIf you don't use apache that often you may just want to keep it in daemon mode and just start it when you need it. Then you can kill it when you are done (be sure to kill the parent and not one of the child processes).\nTo setup inetd mode you need to edit a few files. First in\nsee if http is already in there. If its not then add it:\nRight after 79 (finger) would be a good place. Then you need to edit the\n/etc/inetd.conffile and add the line for Apache:\nBe sure to change the path if you have Apache in a different location. And the second httpd is not a typo; the inet daemon requires that. If you are not currently using the inet daemon, you may want to comment out the rest of the lines in the file so you don't activate other services as well (FTP, finger, telnet, and many other things are usually run from this daemon).\nhttp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/httpd httpd\nIf you are already running the inet deamon (\ninetd), then you only need to\nsend it the SIGHUP signal (via kill; see kill's man page for more info) or\nreboot the computer for changes to take effect. If you are not running\ninetd then you can start it manually. You should also add it to your\ninit files so it is loaded at boot (the\nrc.local file may be a good\nThe newer web publishing tools support this new method of uploading web pages by http (instead of FTP). Some of these products don't even support FTP anymore! Apache does support this, but it is lacking a script to handle the requests. This script could be a big security hole, be sure you know what you are doing before attempting to write or install one.\nIf anyone knows of a script that works let me know and I'll include the address to it here.\nFor more information goto Apacheweek's article at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put.\nThis is one of my favorite features. It allows you to password protect a directory or a file without using CGI scripts. It also allows you to deny or grant access based on the IP address or domain name of the client. That is a great feature for keeping jerks out of your message boards and guest books (you get the IP or domain name from the log files).\nTo allow user authentication the directory must have\nAuthConfig set in the\naccess.conf file. To allow access control (by domain\nor IP address) AllowOverrides Limit must be set for that directory.\nSetting up the directory involves putting an\n.htaccess file in the\ndirectory. For user authentication it is usually used with\n.htpasswd and optionally a\n.htgroup file. Those files can be shared among\n.htaccess files if you wish.\nFor security reasons I recommend that everyone use these directives in there access.conf file:\n<files ~ \"/\\.ht\"> order deny,allow deny from all </files>\nIf you are not the administrator of the system you can also put it in your .htaccess file if AllowOverride Limit is set for your directory. This directive will prevent people from looking into your access control files (.htaccess, .htpasswd, etc).\nThere are many different options and file types that can be used with access control. Therefore it is beyond the scope of this document to describe the files. For information on how to setup User Authentication see the Apacheweek feature at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth or the NCSA pages at http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs-1.5/tutorials/user.html.\nThe su-exec feature runs CGI scripts as the user of the owner. Normally it is run as the user of the web server (usually nobody). This allows users to access there own files in CGI scripts without making them world writable (a security hole). But if you are not careful you can create a bigger security hole by using the su-exec code. The su-exec code does security checks before executing the scripts, but if you set it up wrong you will have a security hole.\nThe su-exec code is not for amateurs. Don't use it if you don't know what you are doing. You could end up with a gaping security hole where your users can gain root access to your system. Do not modify the code for any reason. Be sure to read all the documentation carefully. The su-exec code is hard to setup on purpose, to keep the amateurs out (everything must be done manually, no make file no install scripts).\nThe su-exec code resides in the\nsupport directory of the source. First you\nneed to edit the\nsuexec.h file for your system. Then you need to compile\nthe su-exec code with this command:\nThen copy the suexec executable to the proper directory. The Apache default is\ngcc suexec.c -o suexec\n/usr/local/etc/httpd/sbin/. This can be changed by editing\nhttpd.hin the Apache source and recompiling Apache. Apache will only look in this directory, it will not search the path. Next the file needs to be changed to user root (\nchown root suexec) and the suid bit needs to be set (\nchmod 4711 suexec). Finally restart Apache, it should display a message on the console that su-exec is being used.\nCGI scripts should be set world executable like normal. They will\nautomaticaly be run as the owner of the CGI script. If you set the SUID (set user id) bit on the\nCGI scripts they will not run. If the directory or file is world or group\nwritable the script will not run. Scripts owned by system users will not be\nrun (root, bin, etc.). For other security conditions that must\nbe met see the su-exec documentation. If you are having problems see the\nsu-exec log file named\nSu-exec does not work if you are running Apache from inetd, it only works in daemon mode. It will be fixed in the next version because there will be no inetd mode. If you like playing around in source code, you can edit the http_main.c. You want to get rid of the line where Apache announces that it is using the su-exec wrapper (It wrongly prints this in front of the output of everything).\nBe sure and read the Apache documentation on su-exec. It is included with the source and is available on the Apache web site at http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html\nApache has the ability to handle server side imagemaps. Imagemaps are\nimages on webpages that take users to different locations depending on\nwhere they click. To enable imagemaps first make sure the imagemap module\nis installed (its one of the default modules). Next you need to uncomment\n.map handler at the end of the\nsrm.conf file. Now all files ending in\n.map will be imagemap files. Imagemap files map different areas on the\nimage to separate links. Apache uses map files in the standard NCSA\nformat. Here is an example of using a map file in a web page:\nIn this example\n<a href=\"/map/mapfile.map\"> <img src=\"picture.gif\" ISMAP> </a>\nmapfile.mapis the mapfile, and\npicture.gifis the image to click on.\nThere are many programs that can generate NCSA compatible map files or you can create them yourself. For a more detailed discussion of imagemaps and map files see the Apacheweek feature at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/imagemaps.\nServer Side Includes (SSI) adds dynamic content to otherwise static web pages. The includes are embedded in the web page as comments. The web server then parses these includes and passes the results to the web server. SSI can add headers and footers to documents, add date the document was last updated, execute a system command or a CGI script. With the new eXtended Server Side Includes (XSSI) you can do a whole lot more. XSSI adds variables and flow control statements (if, else, etc). Its almost like having an programming language to work with.\nParsing all HTML files for SSI commands would waste allot of system\nresources. Therefore you need to distinguish normal HTML files from those\nthat contain SSI commands. This is usually done by changing the extension\nof the SSI enhanced HTML files. Usually the\n.shtml extension is used.\nTo enable SSI/XSSI first make sure that the includes module is installed.\nsrm.conf and uncomment the\nAddHandler directives for\n.shtml files. Finally you must set\nOptions Includes for all directories where\nyou want to run SSI/XSSI files. This is done in the\naccess.conf file.

{"text": "MySQL has the advantage of containing several storage engines providing you with what is effectively several different types of databases in one software package. You install MySQL then choose MyISAM or InnoDB or one of the other storage engines. InnoDB became the default in MySQL 5.1.\nInnoDB is now the default database engine and is benefiting from the extra focus. MySQL 5.5 includes InnoDB enhancements to make better use of storage technology coupled with multiple processor cores. The main change splits a workload into two separate streams to let the workloads run on separate cores. Input/Output requests should start faster, producing more requests per second. You then need faster disks to serve those extra requests.\nThere are several improvements to make better use of multiple core processors. You will not see a difference when you step up from 2 cores to 4 cores. The difference will be noticeable when you jump up to 12 cores, as provided in an AMD Operon chip.\nThe improvement is created by splitting workloads into multiple streams to let them run in parallel. Some of the workloads are controlled by parameters you can set to fit your hardware. There is more statistical information recorded to help you tune the workloads.\nBenchmarks show there is little difference for 4 cores or less because there were already enough streams running in parallel. There is little benefit above 30 cores because there are not enough streams to service more cores.\nThis is a bit like backing up your data with RAID 1. You get at least two copies. The process works when you replicate from a master database to some slaves.\nThink of a master database replicating updates to several slave databases to serve many Web servers. You commit a transaction on the master and the change is saved to the master before the transaction is completed. You have one safe copy. Then your master server dies and you have no safe copies.\nTry that again with semisynchronous replication. You commit the transaction. MySQL updates the master but does not tell you the transaction is finished. Instead it waits for one slave to take a copy of the update. When the slave has secured a copy of the update and replied to the master, the master tells your program the transaction is complete. The master server dies. You simply switch the slave to become the master and carry on with 100 percent of your data.\nThis feature is definitely of value to people running transactions in a master/slave replication.\nMySQL installs easily on Windows if you have administrative access. There are 32 bit and 64 bit versions for automatic installation.\nOracle own MySQL and Oracle sell a rebranded Red Hat Linux. MySQL is available for both. MySQL is also available in source code andgeneric forms for Linux and some Unixes.\nMySQL is not available in Deb format for automatic installation in Debian or derivatives of Debian including Ubuntu and Linux Mint. Some applications are also available in a PPA library for automatic download bypassing the Debian and Ubuntu releases. MySQL is not available in PPA form.\nThere are promises to set up a PPA library and a Deb download and to fast track MySQL 5.5 into Debian.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Attack on computer memory reveals vulnerability of widely used security systems\nPosted February 21, 2008; 11:42 a.m.\nA team of academic, industry and independent researchers has demonstrated a new class of computer attacks that compromise the contents of \"secure\" memory systems, particularly in laptops.\nThe attacks overcome a broad set of security measures called \"disk encryption,\" which are meant to secure information stored in a computer's permanent memory. The researchers cracked several widely used technologies, including Microsoft's BitLocker, Apple's FileVault and Linux's dm-crypt, and described the attacks in a paper and video published on the Web Feb. 21.\nThe team reports that these attacks are likely to be effective at cracking many other disk encryption systems because these technologies have architectural features in common.\n\"We've broken disk encryption products in exactly the case when they seem to be most important these days: laptops that contain sensitive corporate data or personal information about business customers,\" said Alex Halderman, a Ph.D. candidate in Princeton's computer science department. \"Unlike many security problems, this isn't a minor flaw; it is a fundamental limitation in the way these systems were designed.\"\nThe attack is particularly effective against computers that are turned on but are locked, such as laptops that are in a \"sleep\" or hibernation mode. One effective countermeasure is to turn a computer off entirely, though in some cases even this does not provide protection.\nHalderman's Princeton collaborators included graduate students Nadia Heninger, William Clarkson, Joseph Calandrino and Ariel Feldman and Professor Edward Felten, the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy. The team also included Seth Schoen of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, William Paul of Wind River Systems and independent computer security researcher Jacob Appelbaum.\nFelten said the findings demonstrate the risks associated with recent high-profile laptop thefts, including a Veterans Administration computer containing information on 26 million veterans and a University of California-Berkeley laptop that contained information on more than 98,000 graduate students and others. While it is widely believed that disk encryption would protect sensitive information in instances like these, the new research demonstrates that the information could easily be read even when data is encrypted.\n\"Disk encryption is often recommended as a magic bullet against the loss of private data on laptops,\" Felten said. \"Our results show that disk encryption provides less protection than previously thought. Even encrypted data can be vulnerable if an intruder gets access to the laptop.\"\nThe new attacks exploit the fact that information stored in a computer's temporary working memory, or RAM, does not disappear immediately when a computer is shut off or when the memory chip is taken from the machine, as is commonly thought. Under normal circumstances, the data gradually decays over a period of several seconds to a minute. The process can be slowed considerably using simple techniques to cool the chips to low temperatures.\nDisk encryption technologies rely on the use of secret keys -- essentially large random numbers -- to encode and protect information. Computers need these keys to access files stored on their own hard disks or other storage systems. Once an authorized user has typed in a password, computers typically store the keys in the temporary RAM so that protected information can be accessed regularly. The keys are meant to disappear as soon as the RAM chips lose power.\nThe team wrote programs that gained access to essential encryption information automatically after cutting power to machines and rebooting them. The method worked when the attackers had physical access to the computer and when they accessed it remotely over a computer network. The attack even worked when the encryption key had already started to decay, because the researchers were able to reconstruct it from multiple derivative keys that were also stored in memory.\nIn one extremely powerful version of the attack, they were able to obtain the correct encryption data even when the memory chip was physically removed from one computer and placed in another machine. After obtaining the encryption key, they could then easily access all information on the original machine.\n\"This method is extremely resistant to countermeasures that defensive programs on the original computer might try to take,\" Halderman said.\nThe attacks demonstrate the vulnerability of machines when they are in an active state, including \"sleep mode\" or the \"screen lock\" mode that laptops enter when their covers are shut. Even though the machines require a password to unlock the screen, the encryption keys are already located in the RAM, which provides an opportunity for attackers with malicious intent.\nNone of the attacks required specialized equipment. \"I think we're going to see attackers doing things that people have previously though impractical or impossible,\" Appelbaum said.\nThe researchers were able to extend the life of the information in RAM by cooling it using readily available \"canned air\" keyboard dusting products. When turned upside down, these canisters spray very cold liquid. Discharging the cold liquid onto a memory chip, the researchers were able to lower the temperature of the memory to -50 degrees Celsius. This slowed the decay rates enough that an attacker who cut power for 10 minutes would still be able to recover 99.9 percent of the information in the RAM correctly.\n\"Hints of problems associated with computers retaining their temporary memory have appeared in the scientific literature, but this is the first systematic examination of the security implications,\" said Schoen.\nThe researchers posted the paper describing their findings on the website of Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy. They submitted the paper for publication and it is currently undergoing review.\nIn the meantime, the researchers have contacted several manufacturers to make them aware of the vulnerability: Microsoft, which includes BitLocker in some versions of Windows Vista; Apple, which created FileVault; and the makers of dm-crypt and TrueCrypt, which are open-source products for Windows and Linux platforms.\n\"There's not much they can do at this point,\" Halderman said. \"In the short term, they can warn their customers about the vulnerability and tell them to shut their computers down completely when traveling.\"\nIn the longer term, Halderman said new technologies may need to be designed that do not require the storing of encryption keys in the RAM, given its inherent vulnerability. The researchers plan to continue investigating this and other defenses against this new security threat.", "label": 1}
{"text": "A Tale of Two Passwords\nMarch 05, 2008\nLearn the secrets to savvy password creation.\nThere's no two ways about itpasswords can be a pain in the...well, you know. Most people would avoid dealing with them if they could and thus engage in some bad password habits, like creating overly simplistic passwords (plus using the same password for everything) and failing to change default passwords.\nOn your broadband router, there are two passwords in particular, that when set improperly, can leave your network vulnerable.\nRouter Administration Password\nThis is a password that's commonly overlooked. Given that people may seldom need to access the router's settings beyond an initial configuration, many either inadvertently or intentionally leave the password at its factory default value, which is usually the manufacturer's name, \"password,\" \"1234\" or sometimes even no password at all.\nLast year, some security researchers effectively invented and documented this kind of attack. In a nutshell, code embedded in a Web page or e-mail message is used to remotely log into a router using a known default password. (The default password for almost any brand and model of router is easily looked up online. See for yourself at www.routerpasswords.com, which is just one site among many.)\nIn drive-by pharming, once granted access to the router, an attacker can then configure it to use the attacker's own DNS servers not unlike how we configured a router to use OpenDNS a few weeks back and from there exercise total control over which sites the user is taken to. (For a narrated animation describing how a drive-by pharming attack works, check out www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/weblog/upload/2007/02/db-pharming.html.)\nWhat was once a theoretical risk has (perhaps inevitably) become a very real one. According to Symantec security researcher Zulfikar Ramzanone of the researchers who originally discovered and documented the attack drive-by pharming has now just been spotted \"in the wild\", which means it's actually been done in the real world as opposed to just in a computer lab. It was in Mexico, to be specific, where it was used to redirect folks using a specific router to a faux Web site posing as that of a major bank. (Read a detailed description on Ramzan's blog.)\nLong story short, if you're one of those that forgot to change your router's password or didn't think you needed to, now is an excellent time to log you're your router and correct that mistake. If you don't know your router's default password offhand, you'll very likely find it on the site mentioned above.\nAnother router-based password that you'll want to take a close look at is the one you use to WPA-encrypt your wireless network. Those in the know wisely choose WPA over WEP because of the superior security it can provide, but this isn't automatic the password you create will directly affect the level of protection you receive.\nCase in point: a WPA password can be as short as 8 characters or as long as 63, but as with all passwords, there's a tendency to use the shortest and easiest to remember WPA password possible. People commonly set up WPA passwords that are dictionary words or proper names of family members or pets, because it must be typed into every device on their wireless networks.\nOne of the reasons WEP is so weak is because it uses a static encryption key which can eventually be decoded if you monitor the network long enoughoften for just hours or minutes. WPA is better because it uses the password you specify to generate a constantly-changing series of encryption keys. But all those keys are still derived from that single WPA password (also known as the Pre-Shared Key, or PSK), so a longer and more complex password will produce keys that are stronger and harder to decode. Put another way, a lengthy WPA password made up of random characters is far preferable to something like \"samandmary\".\nIf you're using such a short-and-simple WPA key, it's highly advisable that you change it. Don't despair about having come up with a long complicated password, though, because there are Web sites that can help. You can head over to www.passpub.com/wpa256.php to grab an instant 52 character key, or generate a custom-length password at www.kurtm.net/wpa-pskgen/. (The former site sends your key over an SSL-encrypted connection, while the latter generates it directly on your computer, so there's no danger of eavesdropping.)\nAnd yes, you will have the inconvenience of entering your newly long and cumbersome key at each of your wireless computers. But you'll only have to do it once, and it's a small price to pay for better security. These days, you can't be too careful.\nStory courtesy of PracticallyNetworked.

However, we also need to think about protecting the Internet from kids who might abuse it.\nThe Department of Justice categorizes computer crime in three ways:\n- The computer as a target - attacking the computers of others (spreading viruses is an example).\n- The computer as a weapon - using a computer to commit \"traditional crime\" that we see in the physical world (such as fraud or illegal gambling).\n- The computer as an accessory - using a computer as a \"fancy filing cabinet\" to store illegal or stolen information.\nReports of alleged computer crime have been a hot news item of late. Especially alarming is the realization that many of the masterminds behind these criminal acts are mere kids. In fact, children no longer need to be highly skilled in order to execute cyber crimes. \"Hacker tools\" are easily available on the Net and, once downloaded, can be used by even novice computer users. This greatly expands the population of possible wrongdoers. Children (and in some cases - their parents) often think that shutting down or defacing Web sites or releasing network viruses are amusing pranks. Kids might not even realize that what they are doing is illegal. Still other kids might find themselves hanging out online with skilled hackers who share hacking tools with them and encourage them to do inappropriate things online. Unfortunately, some of these kids don't realize that they are committing crimes until it is too late. Even more distressing and difficult to combat is the fact that some in the media portray the computer criminal as a modern day Robin Hood. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nSo what are cyber crimes? Can the law enforcement authorities find criminals online? How can you create context for your children to understand what cyber crimes are?

{"text": "Every computer that is connected in some way to the internet should be running software designed to protect the system from the numerous security risks that are easily encountered in \"cyberspace\". In a perfect world, this would be all that the user would need to do to protect a computer from viruses and spyware. Unfortunately, due to the dynamic nature of the internet, and the almost constant proliferation of new bugs, viruses, and spyware, even the best anti-virus software will never be able to provide 100% protection for your computer. The following is a guide that provides basic maintenance and troubleshooting steps that the general user can use to cleanup and safeguard their system.\n- First, as stated, make sure that you are running the most current updates for an anti-virus software package. If you do not have software of this type on your computer, a good freeware anti-virus program is AVG Antivirus, which is free to individual users for home/dorm-use. Although most reputable anti-virus applications will automatically download current updates, in the end it is the user's responsibility to make sure that software is current. Updates should be performed at least once a week. This is (as mentioned earlier) crucial to the effectiveness of the software, because new security risks arise daily. (It is also imperative that all Windows Security Updates and Service Packs be installed, especially Service Pack 2 with the Firewall enabled.)\nIn addition to anti-virus software, most people will also want to run anti-spyware/adware applications on their computer. While not necessarily malicious, spyware and adware nevertheless pose a serious risk to your personal information. The majority of these programs are downloaded in conjunction with free software that the user has installed on his or her computer, but some are bundled with more \"reputable\" programs that the user has paid for! Adware and spyware usually run totally unnoticed in the background, \"mining\" the user's personal information and at the very least using up system resources. Spybot Search & Destroy and AdAware are two software packages that are excellent for screening your system for adware and spyware. Be aware, however, that most of the time \"free\" software will be disabled if the adware/spyware associated with it is eliminated. A few software packages that are notorious for bundling malware are:\n- Kazaa, Morpheus, iMesh, BearShare, (and any number of other \"Peer-to-peer\" file sharing programs.): Peer to peer (or \"P2P\") file sharing puts your computer at the highest risk for infection. In addition to this, most \"free\" P2P applications of this type come bundled with adware that cannot be disabled without disabling the P2P application as well.\n- RealPlayer: a media player that is (unfortunately) the only player able to play A/V files with extension \".rm\" Unless a user has a very pressing need to view files of this type, it is strongly recommended that this application be avoided.\nAfter running updated malware removal software on your computer, you can also check your (Windows) system directly.\n- Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete at the same time will bring up the Windows-Security Menu.\n- Click on the Task Manager button.\n- Choosing the Processes Tab will display a full list of all processes that are currently running on the computer. Running a check on google using the name of any of these processes (svchost.exe, for example) should display any number of websites that will reveal what the process's job is. If the process has something to do with malware, your web-search will most likely find some sites that will not only tell you what the process is doing, but should also contain instructions on removing the problem. If you suspect that a process may be suspect, you can also go directly to an antivirus website such as Symantec or Sophos, and search their online database directly for information.\n- Though all these steps go a long way toward keeping your system secure, new security threats are always popping up, and \"hackers\" can be quite ingenious when it comes to finding ways to bury their code in your system.

{"text": "Our passwords give us access to a number of very valuable resources. They control access to our bank accounts, photos of our families, email correspondence, and all kinds of other information. As valuable as all this information is, it is amazing how little effort most people put into making sure they have good passwords. Here are six password resolutions for 2009 to help protect your data with more secure passwords.\n1. Resolve to use different passwords on each website.\nThere are a few ways to do this. The most secure is to use a completely different randomly generated password on each site. If you use a password management program like 1Passwd this isn’t too difficult. Another option is to create a scheme that allows you to modify your password slightly based on each site. For example, if you use a base password of $5*9twoop, you could use $5*9twoop6 for Amazon.com, $5*9twoop5 for Yahoo.com and $5*9twoop3 for wsj.com. The last number is just the number of characters in the domain name that comes before the .com of each site.\nThis doesn’t make for the most secure passwords, but if some website is hacked or someone gets one of your passwords they won’t automatically have all of your password for every site.\n2. Resolve to use longer passwords.\nThere are two types of brute force approaches to cracking passwords. One is to try every possible combination of letters in sequence. For example, trying every three letter password would look like: aaa, aab, aac, aad, etc. Another common approach is to use a dictionary and just try common words that might be used as a password. Unless you are using a dictionary word, an eight character password is going to be much more difficult to break than a six character one. I’ve started using passwords that are over 10 characters long. We will talk about passphrases in a minute as a way to accomplish this.\n3. Resolve to keep password lists encrypted.\nIf you use a different password for every site, you will probably need to keep a record of them somewhere–particularly if you use completely random passwords and not some scheme like we mentioned in point one. If you use password management software, it may support automatic encryption. If you just keep them in a text file, you will need to investigate other encryption methods.\n4. Resolve to use random symbols in passwords.\nPasswords that have symbols (like *#&@!) are much more difficult to break using a brute force attack. Along the same lines you should make sure you can use both capital and lower case letters.\n5. Resolve to use passphrases.\nPasswords like The^funny@clown! are much more secure than a password like clown99 or Cl()wn simply because they are longer. With a phrase, you get a memorable password while increasing the length considerably.\n6. Resolve to password protect your computer.\nIf the average computer is stolen, simply turning it on will get you access to everything on the hard drive. At the very least, you laptop should prompt you for a password when you boot it and when it comes out of sleep mode. This doesn’t protect the hard drive like encrypting all of your data, but if a thief is after your hardware (not your data) they will probably just reinstall the OS to sell the machine. If they immediately have access to all your data, you significantly increase your chances of them poking around a bit to see if they can find any valuable information before selling it.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Internal security is a longstanding issue on the political agenda, and governments provide well for it.\nTwo issues have recently provided challenges to internal security policy. First, extremist right- and left-wing activities are an increasing problem, arising mainly but not exclusively in the federal states of the former East Germany. Second, fighting terrorist and extremist activities has emerged as both a domestic and international phenomenon. Recent events have clearly demonstrated that even small terrorist groups of Islamic fundamentalists are able to paralyze the whole security system for weeks at a time. Today, internal security policy is closely intertwined with EU strategies and policies.\nDue to the events of 9/11 and its effects on the subsequent “war on terrorism,” former Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble focused on policies strengthening internal security in order to prevent future terrorist attacks. In 2007, there was a debate on data retention, with policy mandating the storage of all phone and Internet communications for six months. In Germany, the government implemented an EU policy on data retention, but this law was overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court in March 2010.\nAnother law enables the police forces of the Federal Criminal Police Office to implement preventive measures against terrorism, including monitoring private communications via personal computers or telephones, and observing individuals with video cameras. There has also been some debate over how the military forces could be used domestically to prevent terrorist attacks, an idea that was ultimately dropped.\nIn 2009, the EU Commission recommended the implementation of body scanners at European airports to increase safety. Most European governments initially refused to use them, but another failed attack would probably lead the scanners to be implemented soon. Generally, the relationship between security and freedom consistently drives heated and controversial discussions. Nonetheless, authorities have so far been successful in preventing major terrorist attacks, at times by detecting conspiracies at an early stage.\nFischer Weltalmanach 2009\nhttp://ww w.bmi.bund.de/cln_174/SharedDocs/Re den/DE/2010/01/rede_bt.html\nhttp:/ /www.bmi.bund.de/cln_174/SharedDocs /Pressemitteilungen/DE/2010/03/politisch_motivierte_kriminalitaet.html ?nn=303936\nBusch, Andreas, 2010: Kontinuität statt Wandel: Die Innen- und Rechtspolitik der Großen Koalition, in: Christoph Egle/Reimut Zohlnhöfer (eds): Die zweite Große Koalition.

{"text": "|By K. Thor Jensen May 5, 2011|\nAs email began to become the preferred method of business communication, it became only natural for virus makers to start treating it as a disease vector. One of the first worms to get major attention was the Melissa virus, created in 1999 by David L. Smith and named after a stripper he had a crush on. Sent through an email, it was built on a simple Microsoft Word macro - if you opened the attached document, it would automatically replicate itself and re-send to the top 50 names in your address book. Melissa crashed multiple networks before it was contained, but it was only the beginning.\nAs more and more people started using email in their daily life, it's not surprising that virus makers are targeting kids with their work as well. The 2007 Pikachu worm is widely regarded to be the first piece of malware that focused on the pre-teen set. An email containing an image of the electric mouse Pokemon and some amazing Engrish reading \"Between millions of people around the world I found you. Don't forget to remember this day every time MY FRIEND.\" led to a mass email to everybody in your address book as well as the addition of instructions to your autoexec.bat file that would wipe your hard drive on next boot.\nOne of the most devastating aspects of viruses is how they can lay dormant in your computer waiting for further instructions. The first virus to really create a worldwide panic was dubbed Michelangelo after its date of activation - on March 6th, the famous painter's birthday, this malicious bit of code would roar into action and delete the first 100 sectors of your hard drive, rendering your machine inoperative. Things got really crazy when it was discovered that some hardware manufacturers including Intel had shipped products that were accidentally pre-infected with the virus, and the media actually advised people to not turn their computers on at all on the 6th until a cure could be found.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Experts Want To Keep Your Car’s Computer Safe From Attack\nMichael Harper for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online\nA virus on a computer can be bad enough, possibly leading to hacked accounts and even broken hardware. A virus on your car’s computer however, could be downright dangerous.\nAs our world progresses, so too does our desire to computerize everything, and our cars have become quite advanced. Staying one step ahead, the McAfee team at Intel Corp has been working away in a very unusual office for computer programmers and hackers: a West Coast garage.\nMcAfee, makers of the popular anti-virus software, are just one of the teams looking to protect automobiles from many bugs and viruses which could wreak havoc on the tiny computers inside modern cars.\nAs the cars become increasingly advanced and the technology becomes cheaper, more and more of these wide open and vulnerable computers are driving freely on our Nation’s interstates, freeways and city streets. According to some experts, many automakers have yet to address the issue, giving hackers the ability to not only eavesdrop, but also steal cars and potentially cause them to crash into one another.\nThough there have yet to be any violent attacks on car computers reported, companies like Intel’s McAfee and even Ford Motor Company aren’t waiting for the hackers to strike first.\n“Ford is taking the threat very seriously and investing in security solutions that are built into the product from the outset,” said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford. According to Hall, his company has given their security engineers the job of making their Sync in-vehicle offerings as imperceptible to hacking attacks as possible.\nIn 2010, a group of computer scientists from the US showed the automobile just how dangerous a virus on a car’s computer could be when they took control and damaged some cars moving at high speeds at a decommissioned airport.\nAfter this exhibit, SAE International, an association of more than 128,000 automobile and aerospace technicians, tasked a committee with advising automobile manufacturers on how to not only detect attacks on their automobiles, but also to prevent infiltrations.\n“Any cyber security breach carries certain risk,” said Jack Pokrzywa, SAE’s manager of ground vehicle standards, speaking to Reuters.\n“SAE Vehicle Electrical System Security Committee is working hard to develop specifications which will reduce that risk in the vehicle area.”\nThe same group of computer scientists who presented that harrowing demonstration in 2010 issued a second report last year, this time saying automobiles can also be susceptible to trojans and worms via their onboard diagnostic systems and even CD players. A hacker disguised as a technician, or a technician turned hacker, could place one of these viruses on a seemingly innocuous plug and install the virus all while appearing to be checking the system’s emissions.\nThough the group of scientists did not mention specifically which car manufacturers they used to demonstrate these security vulnerabilities, they told Reuters that all cars were in danger of being hacked, especially when considering that most of these automakers use the same development processes and suppliers.\nThe world’s largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp, seems confident in their offerings, saying they haven’t heard of any hacking attacks on their cars.\n“They’re basically designed to change coding constantly. I won’t say it’s impossible to hack, but it’s pretty close,” said John Hanson, a spokesman for Toyota.\nLater, Hanson said, “Viruses are something that needs to be addressed directly. How we guard against that transfer to our system is a primary focus of our efforts.”", "label": 1}
{"text": "« More News Stories\nJune 8, 2012—Having successfully coordinated projects that resulted in secure coding standards for the C, C++, and Java programming languages, the CERT Secure Coding Initiative has unveiled work on a draft standard for Perl. The members of the CERT Secure Coding Team have analyzed thousands of vulnerability reports, including reports produced by the CERT Vulnerability Analysis Team, to identify insecure coding practices in Perl. From this analysis, the team has developed the draft Perl secure coding standard. The goal for the standard is to provide software developers with a tool for reducing or eliminating vulnerabilities before deployment. This work is being sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Network Security Deployment Division.\n“In our analysis, we performed Perl code audits using the Source Code Analysis Lab (SCALe),” said the Secure Coding Team’s David Svoboda. “Our audit process presupposes a secure coding standard. So, auditing Perl code required us to have a draft standard, which also served as a nascent set of issues. That is, many of our rules were inspired by vulnerabilities in the code we analyzed.”\nMost software vulnerabilities stem from a relatively small number of common programming errors. Coding standards encourage programmers to follow a uniform set of rules and guidelines determined by the requirements of the project and organization, rather than by the programmer's familiarity or preference. Once established, these standards can be used as a metric to manually or automatically evaluate source code.\nThe draft CERT Perl Secure Coding Standard provides a core of well-documented and enforceable coding rules and recommendations for the Perl programming language. Developing this core of draft rules into a comprehensive standard can help programmers realize significant security improvements in a variety of programming contexts. “Perl is the most prominent scripting language in the Unix world,” noted Svoboda. “It predates other scripting languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby.”\nTo augment the standard, the CERT Program invites collaboration from interested professionals in the software development and software security communities. As with all of the Secure Coding Team’s standards work, the goal of this project is to eliminate insecure coding practices that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. Its application will lead to higher-quality systems that are more robust and resistant to attack. To get involved, software development professionals should visit www.securecoding.cert.org, create an account, sign in, and start commenting on the rules.\nFor more information on the CERT Secure Coding Standard for Perl, please visit www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/perl/CERT+Perl+Secure+Coding+Standard.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Most kids associate October with the scares related to the traditional Halloween standbys – ghosts, witches, and zombies. But, the month also marks National Cyber Security Awareness month, calling attention to frightening things like online identity theft, cyber bullying, viruses and damaging malware.\nIf your teen is among the 93 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds using your family’s laptop, smartphone or tablet to surf the Internet, they are vulnerable to multiple cyber threats, many of which could be detrimental.\nMoreover, teens do not realize the abundance of threats awaiting them, nor do they recognize a tweet or photo upload can impact not only their reputation and future, but their safety, as well. Microsoft’s research shows that 55 percent of teens say they give little or no thought to the consequences of posting something online.\nAnd, according to a recent survey, 1 in 4 parents are overwhelmed by technology and just hope for the best.\n“As hackers continue plotting attacks, the increase in vulnerability among teens is likely, but parents may not realize they are actually the first line of defense in keeping their families safe online,” says Linda McCarthy, cyber security expert, former senior director of internet safety at Symantec and author of “Own Your Space: Keep Yourself and Your Stuff Safe Online.”\nThe increase in prospective cyber threats provides opportunities in the career field of cyber security. If your teen enjoys spending time online, it’s never too early to begin discussing the education required to enter this field.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, cyber security related fields are projected to grow more than 28 percent by 2020. DeVry University, which has partnered with McCarthy to provide complimentary copies of the “Own Your Space” eBook to parents, teachers and teens, recognizes the growing need for professionals with the skills required to protect individuals and organizations from cyber-attacks. By also partnering with technology leaders like Cisco and Microsoft, its students are provided with a mix of relevant theoretical and hands-on education.\nCyber security is a moving target, and as threats develop daily, it’s imperative for parents and teachers to educate teens about these dangers. “The goal is to inform and educate teens, not scare them about the dangers of sharing information online,” says McCarthy. “By protecting your family’s devices and empowering teens with the information needed to recognize impending threats, cyber sabotage is avoidable.”\nDownload the eBook by clicking on the cover image below.\nYou can also download a complimentary copy of the official Facebook Security Guide here.", "label": 1}

There are many reasons for this:\n- Most computers have insecure default configurations.\n- Your software is probably already outdated. New vulnerabilities have likely been discovered between the time the computer was built and configured by the manufacturer and the day you power on your new system.\n- Numerous viruses and worms are already circulating on the Internet capable of taking advantage of the latest vulnerabilities.\n- Hackers know where you are! They regularly scan the common broadband and dial-up IP address ranges.\nBefore You Connect\nLet's talk about what you should do before you connect this new system to the Internet.\nYou should not connect your computer directly to the Internet. You should, instead, use a network firewall or firewall router. A network firewall or firewall router is a hardware device that users can install between the computers on their Local Area Network (LAN) and their broadband device (cable/DSL modem). By blocking inbound access to the computers on the LAN from the Internet at large (yet still allowing the LAN computers' outbound access), a hardware-based firewall can often provide sufficient protection for a user to complete the downloading and installation of necessary software patches. A hardware-based firewall provides a high degree of protection for new computers being brought online.\nIf you're running Windows XP (and if this is a new system, you probably are) you enable the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF).

{"text": "Do you know your child could be a target for identity theft?\n(BPT) - Imagine that you've taught your child everything they need to know about personal finance. Then as he's getting ready to head off to college and applies for financial aid, he's unexpectedly rejected for financial aid due to poor credit. Yet he's never applied for credit in his life. Sounds outrageous, doesn't it? But this can happen to victims of child identity theft\nMost Americans are aware that identity theft is a significant problem, and that it's important to take measures to protect your identity. What people might not know is their children may also be targets of identity theft before they even become old enough to own a credit card. The Federal Trade Commission\nhas identified child identity theft as a growing problem and encourages parents to do what they can to minimize the risks to their children.\nHow does it happen?\nThe most common way a criminal can steal or misuse the identity of a child is to get access to the child's Social Security number. The perpetrator then uses the Social Security number to open credit card accounts or loans, rent an apartment, sign up for utilities like cell phone service, or even apply for a job. Credit issuers often don't have a way to verify the age of the applicant, so if the criminal changes the age of the identity associated with your child, it's possible that the issuer may approve them for credit, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center\nOnce an account has been established in your child's name, it's easier for criminals to establish subsequent accounts until this fraud is discovered. If your child's identity is stolen at an early age and the theft goes undiscovered until she reaches the age where she begins to establish her own credit, it can be very difficult to discover how the fraud first occurred.\nHow can you help prevent it?\nParents can take a number of steps to help prevent their children from becoming identity theft victims:\n* Store your children's Social Security cards in a safe place like a safety deposit box. Only give out your children's Social Security number when it's absolutely necessary, and provide alternate verification whenever possible.\n* Teach your children to never reveal personal information to anyone, no matter how trustworthy that person may seem. People close to the family are often found to be perpetrators in child identity theft cases.\n* If your child receives pre-approved credit card offers in the mail, you may want to check in with a credit reporting agency or Social Security. If you've been contacted by a collection agency regarding an account in your child's name, there's a possibility your child's identity was stolen.\n* Consider signing up your family members for a credit monitoring and identity protection solution such as the Equifax Complete(TM) Family Plan\n, which can help to protect two adults and up to four minor children. With this product, you will be notified of any changes or suspicious activity on your adult credit files; in addition, you can monitor your minor child's identifying information for existence of an Equifax credit file and lock it, thereby preventing creditors from accessing this file while the child is enrolled in the plan.\nBy taking a few extra precautions to protect your children's identities, you can help ensure they get off on the right foot as they become adults and begin establishing their own credit histories.", "label": 1}
{"text": "California's secretary of state, Debra Bowen, believes that open-source software should be used in elections involving electronic voting machines, to protect against error and fraud.\nSpeaking in Cambridge, MA, [on Thursday] during a panel discussion at the EmTech organized by Technology Review, Bowen noted that individual counties are currently responsible for purchasing voting machines. Often the choice is left up to an IT professional who may lack detailed knowledge of cryptography and computer security. But the biggest concern, according to Bowen, is a lack of access to the machines' underlying code. \"Many times, a person has no legal right to review the software, even if they could,\" she said.\nBowen has a history of pushing for greater transparency and accountability in election technology. After taking office in November 2006, she commissioned a top-to-bottom review of e-voting systems, including detailed analyses of source code, documentation, security, and usability. \"All of the systems had security issues,\" Bowen said.\nThe study revealed a variety of problems, from software vulnerabilities that could let an attacker install malicious software that changes the outcome of a vote, to opportunities to tamper with the devices while they are held in storage.\nE-voting companies are working to address these problems, but Bowen is still frustrated that the software running on voting machines is proprietary.\nWhen asked about future elections, Bowen said the one technology she'd like to see integrated into voting systems tomorrow is open-source software for creating ballots and tabulating votes. Both tasks are horrendously complicated, she added, and so need to be very carefully monitored. For example, Los Angeles County alone may use 330 different ballots for a single election, because dozens of local races may be going on in different neighborhoods. And one common problem there with early deployments of touch-screen voting machines was that voters were presented with ballots that didn't show all the races that applied to them.\nTabulating votes is also problematic. Votes arrive through a variety of channels, via mail as well as polling stations, and must be tabulated quickly and accurately. But there is little regulation or oversight of the way existing software does this. \"A lot of the concern comes out of the fact that no one can look at the software,\" Bowen says. She notes that voting-machine analysis often has to be performed under a nondisclosure agreement, meaning that the details of some flaws remain undisclosed.\nMIT computer science professor Ron Rivest, who has studied the security and privacy of voting systems, says that these systems should be designed to work even if the software underneath is somehow flawed. \"Do you have to trust the software in order to trust the election results?\" he asks. The ideal situation, Rivest says, is one where the presence of bugs or malware cannot affect the outcome of an election.", "label": 1}
{"text": "SNMP is a simple protocol that can be used on just about any networking device in use today. In some environments it’s used heavily, in others it’s scarce. Some view it as a security threat; others see it as a way to efficiently manage some of their key systems.\nThe SNMP protocol was designed to provide a \"simple\" method of centralizing the management of TCP/IP-based networks – plain and simple. If you want to manage devices from a central location, the SNMP protocol is what facilitates the transfer of data from the client portion of the equation (the device you are monitoring) to the server portion where the data is centralized in logs for centralized viewing and analysis.\nSNMP design is pretty simple. There are two main players in SNMP. The manager and the agent. The manager is generally the ‘main’ station such as HP Openview.\nThe agent would be the SNMP software running on a client system you are trying to monitor.\nThe manager is usually a software program running on a workstation or larger computer that communicates with agent processes that run on each device being monitored. Agents can be found on switches, firewalls, servers, wireless access points, routers, hubs, and even users' workstations – the list goes on and on. As seen in the illustration, the manager polls the agents making requests for information, and the agents respond when asked with the information requested.\nThe types of data the agent and manager exchange are defined by a database called the management information base (MIB).The MIB is a virtual information store. It is a small database of information and it resides on the agent. Information collected by the agent is stored in the MIB. The MIB is precisely defined; the current Internet standard MIB contains more than a thousand objects. Each object in the MIB represents some specific entity on the managed device.", "label": 1}

Less restrictive versions exist for “secret” and “sensitive but unclassified” material.\nThe system is also available to the Transportation Security Administration and national laboratories.\nIntellipedia is currently being used to assemble a major intelligence report, known as a national intelligence estimate, on Nigeria as well as the State Department’s annual country reports on terrorism, officials said.\nSome day it may also be the path intelligence officials take to produce the president’s daily intelligence briefing.\nBut the system, which makes data available to thousands of users who would not see it otherwise, has also stirred qualms about potential security lapses following the recent media leak of a national intelligence estimate that caused a political uproar by identifying Iraq as a contributor to the growth of global terrorism.\n“We’re taking a risk,” acknowledged Michael Wertheimer, the intelligence community’s chief technical officer. “There’s a risk it’s going to show up in the media, that it’ll be leaked.”\nIntelligence officials say the format is perfect for sharing information between agencies, a centerpiece of the reform legislation that established Negroponte’s office as national intelligence director after the September 11 attacks.\nThey also said it could lead to more accurate intelligence reports because the system allows a wider range of officials to scrutinize material and keeps a complete, permanent record of individual contributions including dissenting points of view.\nThat might help avoid errors of the kind that led to the widely criticized 2002 national intelligence estimate that said Saddam Hussein possessed large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.\nIntelligence officials are so enthusiastic about Intellipedia that they plan to provide access to Britain, Canada and Australia.\nEven China could be granted access to help produce an unclassified intelligence estimate on the worldwide threat posed by infectious diseases.\n“We’d hope to get down to the doctor in Shanghai who may have a useful contribution on avian flu,” senior intelligence analyst Fred Hassani said.\n|copyright © 2006 Reuters.

{"text": "Do you know the most common password in the business world? If you do, that's the problem. Lots of other people also know or can guess: It's Password1.\nThat bit of confirming wisdom is contained in the 2012 Global Security Report from security firm Trustwave, released last month. The report, built on data from 2,000 vulnerability scans at client companies and 300 recent investigations into security breaches, highlights key data security risk areas and trends -- and one of the ongoing ones is selection of an insufficiently obscure and complex password.\nSatisfies Active Directory\nThe most common way of breaking into protected computers or networks is by guessing the password. Password1, in that exact form, satisfies the conditions that are required by Microsoft 's Active Directory, in that it has a capital letter, a number, and a sufficient number of characters.\nWhile Password1 is the most common single password, some variation on the word 'password' accounts for about 5 percent of all passwords. The next most popular, accounting for about 1 percent, is the word 'welcome.'\nTrustwave used several commonly available password-cracking tools on some of its clients' systems. Out of 2.5 million passwords, it was able to figure out about 10 percent of them. Trustwave puts the blame not only on employees, but also on businesses, since they allow employees and system administrators to use weak passwords.\nThe company's Global Security Report also focused on some other data security-related trends. For instance, a new target for hackers is franchises, with more than a third of data security investigations last year involving franchise businesses. One of the reasons that franchises have become popular targets, according to the report, is because the same IT systems are used across multiple stores, providing a larger payoff once that system is broken.\nA key trend cited in the report is a targeting of consumer records, with nearly 90 percent of all attacks intended to acquire personal, confidential information, including credit card data.\nThe food and beverage industry is the top target of cybercriminals, for the second year running. Investigations into data breaches are also rising. Trustwave said that it conducted 42 percent more investigations last year than in 2010, in 18 countries. The company said the increase was due to \"targeted, sophisticated attacks resulting in breaches,\" as well as more Asia-Pacific region investigations.\nThe most likely time for a malicious e-mail attachment to be sent? According to the report, it's between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Eastern time in the U.S.\nThe report also found that the ability or inclination of companies to detect security breaches declined in 2011, with only 16 percent of attacked companies able to determine by themselves that they had been compromised.\nThe other 84 percent had to rely on external information from a regulator, law enforcement or the public. Businesses that had to rely on external information gave the attackers an average of 173.5 days to enjoy that target company's environment without detection.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Helping people with computers... one answer at a time.\nKeeping data on your computer secure is important. Being able to password protect a folder seems an obvious approach. Unfortunately it's not that simple.\nCan I put a password on a folder so that only I can see its contents?\nYes and no.\nYou can do something similar to password protecting it using Windows security features. It depends, though, on using the computer the \"right\" way. On top of that, I actually don't really recommend it. If you have something that you want to password protect and keep secure, I recommend a slightly different approach.\nWindows allows you to place restrictions on who can do what with a folder, or even a file. In Windows Explorer, right click on a folder and Properties, and then click on the Security tab:\nHere you can see the properties of a folder on my machine called \"books\".\nHere you can control who has access to that folder. The default way my machine is set up, everyone can examine the contents of that folder. I can remove that and further restrict on an account-by-account basis which users can access that folder, and whether they can modify, read or even see the folder contents.\nIt's actually very powerful, if a tad complex.\nHowever, it's based on Windows user accounts. Thus if you give your own account full access to the file, as I assume you would, then anyone that can login to the machine as you can immediately access the file. There's no real password on the folder, it's your ability to login to Windows using your login password that controls your access to the file.\nAnd since it's based on Windows user accounts it assumes you're actually using different user accounts for different people. It's very common for that not to be the case.\nThe approach I prefer, and in fact use myself, is to use the free open-source tool TrueCrypt.\nWith TrueCrypt, you create a single file on your computer's hard drive that is encrypted. If someone looks at that file all they see is random data - there's no way to know what that file contains.\nOnce you \"mount\" that file using TrueCrypt, and supply the correct password or pass-phrase to unlock it, the contents of that file appear as another drive on your system.\nFor example, I might have a file \"c:\\Windows\\secretstuff.tc\". There's nothing you can do with that file without TrueCrypt and the password to the file. Since I know the password, I can mount it using TrueCrypt and suddenly a new drive appears - say \"P:\". That drive then contains all my protected files. I can change them, update them, delete them - whatever. Once I'm done, I can hide them all again by simply unmounting the TrueCrypt drive.\nIt's both simple and elegant.\nAnd it's not tied to Windows, user accounts or anything else. In fact, you can copy your encrypted file to another machine entirely and mount it with TrueCrypt. Even using other systems such as Linux.\nAnd while any encryption is vulnerable if you pick a bad password, the actual encryption algorithms used by TrueCrypt are \"industrial strength\" and nearly impossible to crack with current technologies.", "label": 1}
{"text": "updated Jan 27, 2009 12:07 pm | 4,375 views\nThe term \"account harvesting\" refers to the attacking technique or activities of grabbing legitimate user IDs and even passwords to gain access to target systems for illegal or malicious purposes.\nThe term account harvesting refers to the attacking technique or activities of grabbing legitimate user IDs and even passwords to gain access to target systems for illegal or malicious purposes. \nJavvin Technologies \nAccount Harvesting is the process of collecting all the legitimate account names on a system. Sniffing software is often used to harvest accounts.\nAccount Harvesting is often used to refer to computer spammers, individuals who try to sell or seduce others through email advertising or solicitation. Account harvesting involves using computer programs to search areas on the Internet in order to gather lists of email addresses from a number of sources, including chat rooms, domain names, instant message users, message boards, news groups, online directories for Web pages, Web pages, and other online destinations.\nAccount harvesting is a type of authentication attacks. It usually works out for applications that respond differently to a login request with an incorrect user ID and/or an incorrect password. Different reponses from the server to valid versus invalid authentication requests may allow the valid accounts on the system to be guessed and harvested.\nIt is noteworthy that different login error messages may sometimes be intentional - simply to let legal users know immediately what login information is wrong. However, the difference in the application response provides the attacker with significant hints to the correct account information.\nDifference in the application response may be classified into the following:\nCOMMON DEFENSIVE MEASURES\nHere are some common defensive measures against account harvesting:\nEnsure that consistent error messages are utilized for account-relevant requests with multiple outcomes (e.g., incorrect user id and/or incorrect password); To defend against the enumeration of valid accounts, use generic messages like \"Login Invalid\".\nEnsure that the accompanying information items listed below are consistent for different account-relevant error messages:\nEnsure that error messages are returned in approximately the same time. It is also an option to set a random wait time for all responses to conceal the timing details from the attacker.\nAccounts can be locked out temporarily when account harvesting is detected. \nThe attack can be considerably slowed down by the required additional information to access the secret question for a valid account. The additional information can be the birthdate of the user's mother, the combinition of the user's and his wife's birth years, last six of the user's SSN or some numbers on a credit card. without providing the additional information, the access to the selected secret question of an account should not be allowed. \nMonitor and analyze login logs via application intelligence for suspicious login patterns. Such patterns may cover a series of login failures across a list of accounts, a series of login failures across a single account, and a series of login failures for invalid accounts. That will help to detect account harvesting attempts. \nMost of account cracking tools, key-stroke loggers, packet sniffer tools, packet capture utilities, rootkits and Trojan login programs can be leveraged for account harvesting.\nRelated White Papers and Webcasts\nDisclaimer: IT Wiki is a service that allows content to be created and edited by anyone in the community.

{"text": "Over the years, the term malware has been used to describe any type of malicious software, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, scareware, and adware. In the early days of computers, malware was considered more a prank used to annoy people through destructive behavior or to show off programming skills. Basically, the more people your malicious program could infect, the greater your status in certain circles. The malicious programs were often delivered to their intended victims as email attachments, shared through removable storage media or through file-sharing services.\nAlthough malware of this sort caused a wealth of problems for its victims, the driving force behind it did not motivate as many people to get involved because the payoff wasn't as lucrative to a wide base. Today, the driving force behind malware has shifted to money. Because these attacks are driven by financial rewards, there is more malware in the wild than ever before. Not only are more people involved in the creation and distribution of malware, but the attacks have grown more sophisticated. Cyber-criminals have learned how to use malware to turn large profits by:\n- Displaying and clicking ads\n- Stealing confidential data\n- Hijacking user sessions\n- Compromising user login credentials\n- Stealing financial information\n- Making fraudulent purchases\n- Creating spam\n- Launching denial-of-service attacks\nTo deliver their malicious software to as many victims as possible, cyber-criminals have turned to websites as one of their primary sources of distribution.\nPeople have learned not to download files attached to emails, and they have stayed away from popular file-sharing services because so many files are infected with malware. One thing that people have not stopped doing, though, is surfing the Web. According to Internet World Stats (see Resources for a link), in 2011 there were 2,279,709,629 active Internet users, and that number continues to grow.\nWith an attack landscape this large and with so many users not being suspicious, it's no wonder that websites have become the favorite media used to infect users with malware. In fact, malicious websites have become so prevalent that Google blacklists roughly 6,000 websites every day because they carry some sort of malicious software that is dangerous to visitors.\nThose responsible for infecting websites with malware do so in one of three ways:\n- They create a malicious website of their own.\n- They exploit a vulnerability on the web server or in its configuration.\n- They exploit a vulnerability in the applications the website relies on.\nBecause this article focuses on what you can do to prevent your websites from falling victim to these attacks, I address only the latter two methods.\nAfter an attacker has found a vulnerability that he or she can successfully exploit, the attacker needs to determine how he or she will deliver malware to the website's visitors. Table 1 lists some of the common methods.\nTable 1. Common ways websites distribute malware\n|Downloads||The user is tricked into downloading the malicious code. A common tactic used is to tell the visitor that he or she needs to update multimedia software to view a video, or a victim is tricked into downloading a PDF or other type of file that actually contains malware.|\n|Banner ads||Users are tricked into downloading malicious files when they click infected ads that appear on the website.|\nIn addressing server-based vulnerabilities, I look at two of the more popular web server applications on the market: Apache and Microsoft® Internet Information Services (IIS). These two servers power 78.65 percent of all websites.\nBoth Apache and IIS—or any other web server—have vulnerabilities that malicious attackers can exploit. When attackers are able to compromise the server software or the server itself, they are able to upload malicious code or even entire web pages that deliver malware to the site's visitors. Examples of vulnerabilities that allow this type of attack to take place come from two primary sources.\nWhen web server software is installed, the default configuration is usually set up to make publishing a website easy, not secure. Unnecessary modules and services may also be part of a web server's default installation. These extras may give an attacker unrestricted access to your website's files.\nEach operating system, web server software, and version has unique vulnerabilities that can be found with a simple web search. Before a website goes live, any known vulnerabilities should be addressed.\nThis source encompasses all aspects of user authentication and the management of active sessions. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), \"A wide array of account and session management flaws can result in the compromise of user or system administration accounts. Development teams frequently underestimate the complexity of designing an authentication and session management scheme that adequately protects credentials in all aspects of the site.\"\nTo mitigate against this type of vulnerability, those responsible for the administration of the web server and site need to adhere to password policies that determine the strength, storage, and change controls of all passwords. Furthermore, remote management capabilities for the web server should be secured or even turned off so that user credentials are not compromised through transit.\nIf websites were still static text and images, it would be much more difficult for the bad guys to use a legitimate website to serve up malicious software. However, today's websites are powered by databases, complex code, and third-party applications that make the user experience much richer while opening the site to any number of vulnerabilities.\nTake WordPress, for example. This blogging application has changed how websites are created by making it easy for anyone with a bit of technical knowledge to create a multimedia-rich, interactive website. It is so popular that it powers more than 50 million websites. WordPress's ease of use, however, was also the cause of a recent outbreak, in which between 30,000 and 100,000 sites running the application redirected victims to malicious sites.\nSites that installed a particular plug-in found their pages infected with code that redirected visitors to another site. This site would then infect the victim's computer with malware based on the operating system and applications that the computer was running. The Flashback Trojan that infected more than 500,000 Macs was one of the malicious programs that spread through this exploit.\nExamples like this are not limited to WordPress, however. Applications like Joomla!, Drupal, MediaWiki, Magento, Zen Cart, and many others have all had vulnerabilities in them that allow malicious hackers to upload malware to these sites to be distributed to visitors.\nFor attackers to exploit a web application, they must find some type of vulnerability. Unfortunately for the owners of websites, there are so many different types of known vulnerabilities that they can't all be listed here. Some you may be familiar with, however:\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS)\n- Structured Query Language injections\n- Cross-site request forgery injections\n- URL redirects\n- Code execution\n- Cookie manipulation\nAnd the list goes on.\nFortunately, there are ways to find out if your site is vulnerable to any of the known exploits by using web application-penetration techniques. By thoroughly testing a website for known vulnerabilities, you can address these threats before an attack is able to manipulate them to distribute malware to your visitors. You can do so using a variety of open source or commercial tools, or you can outsource the service to companies that specialize in this.\nAlthough penetration testing will help identify problems that need to be fixed in your website's code, web application firewalls can help stop threats before they reach your site. By identifying known attack patterns, you can thwart the efforts of malicious hackers before they are able to cause damage to your site. More advanced web application firewalls can even provide protection against unknown, zero-day threats by identifying illicit traffic.\nWhenever a server is configured, it is a best practice to install only the modules and applications that are necessary. By now, this is not only a best practice but a common practice.\nThere are other basic steps that you should take to limit the vulnerabilities that exist in Apache's web server. Throughout the course of this article, I use the commands relevant to the Ubuntu distribution of Linux®. For Apache running on other operating systems or distributions, simply search for the steps required to perform each task.\nBy default, Apache shows its name and version number upon a web request, announcing to any potential attackers what exactly the website is running. Disabling that banner makes it more\ndifficult to pinpoint any other vulnerabilities. You can do so by navigating to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and disabling the\nAnother default is the ability to print a list of files found in the web site directories. This feature lets an attacker map your server and identify potentially vulnerable files. To mitigate against this issue, you need to disable the autoindex module. Simply open the terminal and use the following commands:\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/autoindex.load\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/autoindex.conf\nWeb-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is the file-access protocol of HTTP that allows for the uploading, downloading, and changing of file contents on a website. In any production website, WebDAV should be disabled so that an attacker cannot change your files to upload malicious code.\nUsing the terminal, you disable the dav, dav_fs, and dav_lock files by removing them with the following:\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav.load\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_fs.conf\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_fs.load\nrm -f /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_lock.load\nrequest can be tricked into printing session cookies and this information used to hijack\na user session to launch an XSS attack. You can disable this trace by navigating to the\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf file and making sure that\nOne thing that makes Windows Server® products so attractive to the consumer market is their ease of installation. Using IIS, a company can get a web server up and running with a few clicks. When the server software is installed out of the box, there is little need for configuration: It's done for you.\nTo address security issues in its web server product, Microsoft has made significant changes to how IIS is configured and what is installed by default. There are, however, some steps that you can take to better protect against threats.\nCode Red and Nimda were both worms that attacked the Windows Server operating system, and both did a great deal of damage. Without adequate antimalware protection on the host operating system itself, a website quickly becomes vulnerable to attack. Using keystroke loggers, Trojans, and other malware, attackers can not only easily compromise the web administrator's login credentials, but they also have the ability to insert malicious code into the files that are served up to people visiting the site.\nAfter antimalware software is installed, it should be immediately updated and then run before any website files are uploaded. If anything is found, all passwords should immediately be changed.\nBefore a web server running IIS goes live, be sure to update the operating system software and web server software with the latest updates from Microsoft. These updates usually contain patches that address vulnerabilities specific to Microsoft products.\nWhen a website is guilty of causing harm to its visitors, you must take steps immediately. To begin with, take down and quarantine your site. If you need to have your site up and running so as to avoid interrupting your business, rely on a backup that is verified malware free.\nWhen your web presence is taken care of, it's time to clean the infected files. Some infections require only the removal of a few lines of code, while more sophisticated attacks might require that you rewrite the entire file. Whatever steps are necessary to remove malware from a site need to be taken at this point.\nWhen Google and the other search engines find a site that is serving malware, they can pull it from their results. This can have devastating effects on a business.\nAfter all malware has been removed and any vulnerabilities patched, submit the site to the search engines for review. If they determine that it is no longer a threat to any visitors, the website can be re-listed and traffic from the search engine can be restored.\nIf the malware infection has compromised user account information, all users should be notified immediately so that they can deal with any ramifications. In addition, an organization will need to see whether any laws or regulations have been violated as a result of the breach and take appropriate measures to mitigate any negative effects and keep them in compliance.\nIn a report by Dasient, approximately 1.1 million websites were found to have some type of malware in the fourth quarter of 2010. Other studies show that 85 percent of all malware comes from the Web. Now, it would be easy to write this off if the sites that were causing all the problems had a malicious intent from the beginning. Unfortunately, it is the small business website, the church website, or even the well-respected news website that is responsible for infecting so many computers.\nThe responsibility for protecting websites against attack is falling on the shoulders of the web developer. The days of sitting back and writing awesome code are over. Now, the developer needs to make sure that his or her code is functional and secure.\nThe techniques listed in this article will certainly help the developer who doesn't understand web site security build a foundation for his or her knowledge, but it shouldn't stop here. The threat landscape changes daily. As zero-day exploits emerge and cyber-criminals adapt to countermeasures, web developers too need to adapt and be on the lookout for how they can better secure their sites.\nInternet World Stats: Find more Internet statistics.\nGoogle blacklists: Read more about why Google blacklists roughly 6,000 websites every day.\nPrevalence of Apache and IIS: According to Netcraft, Apache and IIS power 78.65 percent of all websites.\nWordPress: Read more about the prevalence of WordPress.\n\"Hardening the Linux server:\" Learn how to harden your Linux server (developerWorks, December 2008).\nOWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Threats: Learn more about OWASP and its work.\nWeb development zone: Find resources for Web 2.0, Ajax, wikis, PHP, mashups, and other web projects.\ndeveloperWorks technical events and webcasts: Stay current with technology in these sessions.\ndeveloperWorks on Twitter: Join today to follow developerWorks tweets.\ndeveloperWorks podcasts: Listen to interesting interviews and discussions for software developers.\ndeveloperWorks on-demand demos: Watch demos ranging from product installation and setup for beginners to advanced functionality for experienced developers.\nGet products and technologies\nIBM product evaluation versions: Download or\nexplore the online trials in the IBM SOA Sandbox\nand get your hands on application development tools and middleware products from DB2®, Lotus®, Rational®, Tivoli®, and WebSphere.®\n: Connect with other developerWorks users while exploring the developer-driven blogs, forums, groups, and wikis.\nJeff Orloff is a freelance technology writer who also works as a technology coordinator with the School District of Palm Beach County, Florida.

Sapphire/Slammer SQL.\nTheir names are curious, engaging, almost comical, but computer worms and other viruses are no laughing matter. Viruses and other malicious software cost businesses billions each year, and cause users hours of frustration.\nPart of the problem is that modern viruses spread so quickly, the old ways of combating them are no longer effective. Machines are highly connected, and the Internet is open to everyone, so malicious code can spread remarkably quickly.\n2003, the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis reported\nthat the Sapphire/Slammer SQL worm spread worldwide in only 10 minutes,\nand at its\npeak — three minutes after its release — scanned the Internet at\nmore than 55 million addresses per second. Researchers have speculated that a\nwell-designed worm could infect all vulnerable machines on the Internet within\na few hours of its launch.\nThe problem with our current methods of fighting computer virus attacks is that we cannot cope with unfamiliar enemies. Computer antivirus software recognizes the signatures of known viruses, and gets rid of them. But it can’t get rid of a virus that it hasn’t seen before. Human intervention is needed to identify and analyze the attack code, create a signature for detecting it, and update anti-virus software to recognize and prevent the new attack.\neffective defenses must be able to defend systems from attacks that do not\nConsider the way in which the human immune system works. Viruses\nand bacteria attack their human hosts. The human immune system responds\nby isolating and\nattacking the foreign bodies. It does this, responding to unfamiliar things,\nwhat is familiar and concluding that what is not familiar is foreign and\nmust be eliminated. Unlike computer anti-virus software that recognizes\nof known viruses, the human immune system is able to recognize and destroy\npreviously unknown viruses.\nComputer systems, however, suffer from a lack of diversity. Nearly all computers on the Internet run the same operating systems and applications. Without diversity, systems all are vulnerable to the same attacks. A monoculture enables people to share programs and data, but means attacks can be shared in the same way.\nResearchers are beginning to develop ways to build systems that are diverse as far as attackers are concerned, but still appear the same for legitimate users. DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, is funding research to develop technologies for computer systems that provide critical functions even while under attack. The projects funded under this new initiative include a $1 million contract to researchers at the University of Virginia and Carnegie Mellon University to explore the idea of biologically inspired diversity as an approach to computer security. The project goal is to add an element of diversity throughout the system without changing the way users interact with it.\nResearchers are still grappling with the problem of how to automatically create enough diversity to foil attacks, while preserving the program behavior and performance users expect.\nUnlike nature, where attacks evolve, computer attacks are engineered, and sophisticated attackers can design malicious code intended to circumvent or fool defenses. As in natural selection, there is a continual arms race between those attempting to build secure computer systems, and those attempting to compromise them.\nFor now, computer professionals are racing to keep pace with the attackers and struggling to develop specific defenses for every new attack. Before long, we hope to be able to create the computer equivalent of a broad-based antibiotic that can protect systems from any attack, known or unknown.\nDavid Evans is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science whose research focuses on encryption and computer security.\n|*All opinions on this page belong to the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the University of Virginia.

{"text": "Decision-Making and the Straw Man\nby Rick Brenner\nIn project work, we often make decisions with incomplete information. Sometimes we narrow the options to a few, examine their strengths and risks, and make a choice. In our deliberations, some advocates use a technique called the Straw Man fallacy. It threatens the soundness of the decision, and its use is very common.\nNatalie interrupted Geoff. \"I don't think that's a realistic approach at all. Even if we had the budget, we don't have time to hire thirty people.\"\nGeoff was now on defense. \"I never suggested that — I said that to make the scheduled date would require thirty more people. Hiring is probably the worst way to get there.\"\nPlaying defense, Geoff's task is not only to make his original point, but also to remove the distortions that Natalie has introduced into the debate by using a technique called the Straw Man fallacy.\nTo use Straw Man, you state your partner's position in a form that's easy to refute. Then you refute your restatement of it, often by showing that it has unacceptable implications.\nMost of us use Straw Man from time to time. It's so common that we rarely notice it. Here are some indicators that your partner may have used Straw Man.\n- A sense of frustration\n- Feelings of frustration during debate can arise from many possible sources, but check for Straw Man first.\n- Someone characterizes your position\n- Your partner characterizes your position, and you have little or no opportunity to critique the characterization before the process of drawing extremely undesirable inferences has begun.\n- Absolute language\nThe Straw Man fallacy\nis so common that\nwe rarely notice it\n- In the characterization of your position, nuances and qualifications are removed, and an absolutist version of your position emerges. Words like every, nobody, all, none, always, never, forever, 100%, completely, and so on are good indicators.\n- I never said...\n- If you feel the need to clarify, or to deny that you said something, there's a good chance that your partner has used Straw Man.\nIf the user of Straw Man prevails, success might be based not on the strength of the argument, but on a distorted premise. And anything constructed on that basis is more likely to be wrong. To manage this risk, be prepared to deal with the Straw Man fallacy when it appears.\n- Make sure that everyone understands the Straw Man fallacy, how it works, and what it costs.\n- Notice characterizations\n- When you notice that someone's position is being characterized, speak up. Before the implications begin to flow, ask for discussion of the characterization, and gain agreement that it's fair and complete.\nWhen we use Straw Man in the decision-making context, we typically intend to eliminate something from the list of candidates so that the group will choose one of the other options. This is a setup for tragedy. If the ploy works, we will have chosen that option not by comparing it to the options we do have, but to distortions of them. And we will have built our decision on a foundation of straw. Top Next Issue\nFor more on the Straw Man fallacy, see D. Walton, \"The Straw Man Fallacy,\" in Logic and Argumentation, J. van Bentham, et. al., ed. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1996.

{"text": "Single Sign On\nWhen the World Wide Web made its debut more than a decade ago, keeping track of login names and passwords was fairly simple. As the web grew in popularity, and new services like banking and shopping online came of age, more and more services required users to create special names and passwords to access personal information, or other 'members only' features.\nFor an active Internet user, these login combinations could multiply quickly. Passwords soon needed to be at least eight characters and contain extra numbers or characters to prevent security problems. Some times when you created a new user name, you found your username was in use, and pretty soon you needed a file to keep all your different login combinations straight. Often post-it notes with your usernames and passwords could be found stuck on your monitor or under your keyboard. How secure is that?\nRecently, a new alternative to all the confusion is gaining momentum in the online world, called OpenID. The concept, originally developed in 2005, allows users to get access to any OpenID enabled site using a single 'trusted' username and password. You may already have an OpenID you aren't aware of from services like Google, Yahoo, AOL, Verisign, Paypal and many others. When you encounter a service using OpenID, your username and password is checked from a trusted OpenID source like those mentioned above, and you're granted access.\nThis system is considered to be very secure, and very convenient, and is now being adopted by many government bodies who see the benefits of individuals using a single, secure identification for the web, including the City of Nanaimo.\nOpenID in Government\nThe City of Nanaimo is not alone in recognising this global need. The US Federal Government has recently committed to embrace OpenID to allow simple access to citizen resources (http://openid.net/government/).

Hackers got these poorly-protected passwords, Sony didn’t notify the public for 5 days, so the hackers had a field day with the data and got into several other accounts.\n1. Use unique strong passwords for all of your different “cloud” accounts. This way if one password gets compromised it does not open up all the rest of your accounts as well. Using a password manager like LastPass can help (I swear by it), or you can also create a hard-to-guess-but-easy-to-remember password formula.\n2. Don’t store your passwords in your browser’s memory. Again, LastPass is great for this because it encrypts them.\n3. Investigate the security practices of cloud services you trust with your sensitive data.\nSome of the most high-profile attacks by LulzSec (like the CIA & Senate website attacks) were Denial of Service (DOS) attacks—meaning that they did not actually gain access to any unprotected data. A DOS basically floods a website with so many requests that it can’t process them all and the website goes offline temporarily. It’s like getting everyone you know to go ring someone’s doorbell one after another until they stop answering the door. It might drive that person nuts, but it also doesn’t open the door. These attacks are now commonly performed with botnets—large armies of computers infected with viruses that allow one hacker to direct millions of computers (often unbeknownst to their owners) to access the target website and bring it down. Large cloud services like Amazon and Google are designed to withstand these attacks by re-allocating their enormous computing resources to meet all the requests and keep the websites up and running during the attack. Smaller servers without as many resources are most vulnerable to DoS attacks.\n1. Use virus protection software on your computer and perform all necessary updates as soon as they’re released.\n2. Keep your browser & plugins up to date. This tool will scan your browser and plugins for security vulnerabilities.\nOf course, LulzSec and others have been perpetrating more sophisticated attacks than DoSes. They have been exposing security flaws in their targets’ websites which will eventually lead to better security practices across the board. I know it has forced me to be more careful with my personal security practices and it has been pretty easy to do. (My data was exposed in the Sony hack and last year’s Gawker hack, but I’ve taken some simple steps to minimize the damage that anyone can do.)\nIn the meantime, there is a lot you can do to protect yourself online—even in “The Cloud”.\n- Guard That Password (and Make Sure It’s Encrypted) (nytimes.com)\n- 6 Password Protection Lessons Learned from the Sony Hacker Attack (savings.com)\n- LastPass Alternatives That Keep Your Passwords Safe From Online Hacking (gizmodo.com.au)\n- Hackers attack Sony network again (bbc.co.uk)\n- Sony BMG Greece hacked (go.theregister.com)\n- Why I Can Guess Your iPad Password (techland.time.com)", "label": 1}
{"text": "Malware and spam in blogs\nWhatever attracts us on the Internet also attracts malware. So as blogs (short for web logs) became popular by 2003, spammers and hackers discovered new possibilities to spread spam and malware.\nBlog spam (also called comment spam or spomments) is created by automatically posting random comments or promoting commercial services in the comment section of blogs, as well as in guestbooks, wikis, or other publicly accessible online discussion boards. Any web application that displays hyperlinks submitted by visitors is a potential target.\nThe goal of the spammer is to add links across the web that point to his website, thus artificially increasing that site's search engine ranking and the number of potential visitors and paying customers. This type of spam originally appeared in Internet guestbooks, where spammers repeatedly filled guestbooks with links to their own website and no relevant comment.\nMost blog spam falls into one of three categories:\nComment spam - unsolicited and mostly unrelated comment on a blog that advertises a product or a website. Some of it might be added manually by a person to a particular blog entry, but most comment spam comes from scripts that can add many comments automatically to one post or many posts simultaneously.\nTrackback spam - spammers develop scripts that use blog software's trackback features to automatically place spam on different blogs.\nSpam blog (or splog) - a blog created for no other purpose than to advertise products or point visitors to various websites. Though ignored by most people, these blogs pollute the results of search engines that index websites.\nBlogs hosting malware\nApart from spam, blogs are also becoming a means of spreading malicious code and keylogging software. Blogs are an obvious backdoor opportunity for unknown exploits to invade legitimate sites.\nAccording to a report from March 2011, more than one million websites were believed to be infected with malware in the fourth quarter of 2010, nearly double compared to the previous year. The year 2010 also saw various variants of the computer virus Liza Moon using blogs to spread. Liza Moon has affected more than 4 million website, according to a recent report by AllVoices.com. The virus, named after the website that discovered it, was first reported on March 29 2010, with the first confirmed attack taking place in December 2010.\nThe virus infects computers by injecting malicious SQL codes on a website and redirects users to another website containing a Trojan. Users are then told their computers are infected by a computer virus and are prompted to download an anti virus software called Windows Stability Centre, the report stated.\nAs a blogger, you have several ways of preventing spam comments: from verification text boxes which require human action (such as typing the letters displayed in a picture) to dedicated prevention tools - such as Akismet for Wordpress. You can prevent more serious attacks to the blog structure by keeping your blog platform updated (just like you would do with your operating system).\nIf you don’t have one yourself, but like to read other peoples blogs, you can stay safe by having active and updated internet security software on your PC at all times.", "label": 1}

Blame the spyware for it.\nSpyware is a type of malware which can be installed on computers to collect user information without the owner’s knowledge and permission. Personal computers used to be the target of spyware but as day goes on, keyloggers have been installed on shared, corporate and public computers. Different spyware programs can collect personal information, control user’s activity in the form of webpage redirection, allow download or installation of related spyware, modify computer settings, trasmit information and more.\nTo prevent cases like this, it is important to have antispyware software. There are applications that offer antivirus, antispyware and firewall all in one. But some companies prefer specific programs for each line of security.\nAntispyware for Enterprises is a corporate antispyware solution that can centralize the antispyware monitoring among IT administrators. Businesses need a good antispyware package to ensure security. Though there may be different standard, a good antispyware should be able to do the following: scan, protect, remove and update.

{"text": "By John Kamensky\nOctober 24, 2012\nHow do you organize a cross-agency collaborative effort to get results no single agency could accomplish on its own? The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has developed an inventory of “mechanisms that the federal government uses to lead and implement interagency collaboration,” along with a self-assessment checklist to consider when using them.\nGAO’s latest study on collaborative governance is based on an analysis of more than 300 past GAO reports covering issues such as homeland security, agriculture, and health, as well as a series of interviews with experts on the topic.\nGAO previously reported in 2005 on eight “key practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration,” including leadership, trust, and organizational culture. That report lays out how network managers should behave. But it was largely silent on the structural mechanisms for organizing such collaborative efforts. In 2010, a new law requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop and implement cross-agency priority goals that rely on a great degree of collaboration. These more formal collaborations require mechanisms for accountability, measures of progress, and resource sharing. This spurred congressional interest in understanding more about various mechanisms that the executive branch might use.\nOMB identified 14 cross agency priority goals in the 2013 budget and has begun to implement them. These include goals such as doubling exports, which involves more than eight contributing agencies and over 40 programs within these agencies; and improving cybersecurity, which involves virtually every agency in the government. How should the executive branch best organize these agencies and programs to achieve results?\nThe new GAO report catalogs a dozen specific mechanisms the government currently uses to collaborate across boundaries, ranging from special presidential assistants to the use of social media technologies. More significantly, the report offers a self-assessment checklist (Appendix III) of seven key design features that collaborative network leaders need to consider when using these approaches. These features include:\nThe GAO report also provides concrete examples of the various collaborative mechanisms it has cataloged, ranging from the federal government’s climate change activities, to the use of working capital funds, to the federal response in 2007 to the pandemic flu scare. It also describes how some collaborative mechanisms are used for various purposes, such as policy development, program implementation, oversight, and information sharing.\nInterestingly, in a recent blog post, my colleague Dan Chenok notes that effective collaboration in networks used to implement results-oriented initiatives should rely on more than just practices and mechanisms. He says that government leaders should move beyond collaboration to “joint management.” He observes that “successful leaders in government can follow the enterprise model of the private sector, using technology and information to manage ‘jointly’ across agencies – building from collaborative networks to shared operations.”\nWhat things have you found essential for cross-agency collaboration?\n(Image via Michael D.

{"text": "What comes to your mind when you hear the word hacker? Most of us think hackers are hacking computer security systems to steal important and confidential information. It is only partially true, since there are hackers who contribute real solutions to social problems such as corruption.\nWhen we asked participants of the global Transparency International hackathon that took place on the first weekend of October who considered themselves a hacker, many raised their hands, explaining that they did not see “hacker” as a bad word, and that their role is often misunderstood.\nOne said, “Wikileaks is a collection of hackers who disclose hidden information to the public. It helps people to have access to better information.”\nResponding to the “problem statements” presented by seven participants, our friendly hackers were extremely excited to contribute their skills to provide a technological platform that would address corruption problems. He hopes it will rectify public misperceptions about hackers.\nThe hackers know better than anyone that for social media to help fight corruption, we need to create additional applications that people can use to communicate with each other directly. Twitter has already served as a powerful communication tool has already happened in Egypt.\nTeten Masduki, secretary general of Transparency International Indonesia argues that Wikileaks developed as a form of disclosure to dismantle some of the control over information held byelites. “In Indonesia, Facebook and Twitter are a way to curb corruption,” he explained.\nTeten observes that ministries and state agencies have not provided enough information for the public. They provide very limited basic information. “This has little benefit for the community,” he said.\nSouth Asian presence in Jakarta\nProgrammers, developers, graphic and interface designers and anti-corruption activists joined us in Jakarta from South Korea, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Participants from Indonesia also came from various areas such as Jakarta, Semarang, Batang, Yogyakarta, Bandung, Bekasi, Balikpapan and Makassar. They submitted 12 “problem statements” – challenges in our daily efforts to fight corruption that we want technology to help with:\n- TI Indonesia wanted a Corruption Court Decisions Index. This tool is expected to gauge public perception of fairness judgments of national and local level. We crave a site that shows information about the corruption proceedings, a little like our name and shame site for corruption offenders.\n- Our Malaysian colleagues wanted to enhance their Forest Watch illegal logging site where people can tag areas affected by illegal logging. Likewise, there is a clear demand for a system that can measure the performance of public institutions as well as reporting public services using photos and comments to the local council.\n- Much of the requests of Transparency International staff to the hackers related to areas they are already working in. Awareness raising is a priority for TI Sri Lanka, who regularly hold public exhibitions. TI Vietnam, whose recent study showed 30% of people facing bribes in the health sector, concentrated on the assessment of public health services.\n- An online platform for corruption reporting is also vital for TI South Korea, which the public would be able to access through smartphones, either as victims, witnesses or whistleblowers. Previously, their site has provided anti-corruption education in the form of a quiz.\n- TI Fiji wanted online campaign tools to engage youth in the fight against corruption and a platform to monitor intimidation, violence and irregularity during elections.\nThe Hackathon was held in 5 countries simultaneously. Beside Jakarta, Transparency International organised the same event in Moscow (Russia), Bogota (Columbia), Budapest (Hungary), and Vilnius (Lithuania).

{"text": "Storage area network (SAN) management is more involved than simply cabling servers and storage systems together. Storage resources must be configured, allocated, tested and maintained as new devices\nStorage resource management (SRM) applications are designed to monitor and manage physical and logical SAN resources. Physical resources include storage arrays, RAID systems, tape libraries and FC switches, while logical storage features involve file systems and application-oriented storage elements (e.g. Oracle database files). It's usually best to select one tool that can provide centralized management of the entire storage infrastructure through a single console. Ideally, a centralized SRM tool should be able to detect storage resources, evaluate their capacity and configuration, and measure their performance. The SRM tool should also be able to affect changes to the configuration and support consistent policies across the various storage technologies being managed. SAN management tools are available from EMC Corp., Symantec Corp. (Veritas), McData Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM, Sun Microsystems Inc. and CA Inc.\nIn actual practice, selecting a SAN management/SRM tool can be an extremely challenging process -- usually because each tool accomplishes its suite of tasks in a unique way. Consequently, a good management tool should offer heterogeneous support, being able to accurately detect, discover and visualize a SAN across a variety of network equipment, storage systems and operating systems.

{"text": "E-mail (in its simplest form) is inherently insecure. There's no built-in encryption, so it's easy to snoop on people's messages as they're sent across the network, and there's no built-in validation, so it's easy to spoof a message to make it look like it came from somebody else. If you're a mischievous college student, you can exploit these vulnerabilities to read your roommate's mail, or send fake love letters from your roommate to the creepy goth chick down the hall. But if you're an actual criminal, you can exploit these vulnerabilities to commit fraud, industrial espionage, or treason. S/MIME solves these problems by providing certain cryptographic guarantees, including authentication, message integrity, and privacy.\nGuaranteeing authentication, message integrity, and privacy (and making it all easy-to-use) is actually a really hard thing to do. A search of the web for \"encrypted e-mail\" turns up solutions like this one, but these types of applications tend to suffer from the same types of problems.\n- Key Distribution: Home-grown systems tend to use a single symmetric key that all trusted parties share. But trying to let the trusted parties know what the key is results in a chicken-and-egg scenario. There's no secure channel without the secret key, so that means that you have to send the secret key to all trusted parties in an insecure way. A better system would allow you to negotiate a channel in a secure way, without having to distribute any secret information ahead of time.\n- Key Management: A single shared key creates two classes of people. If you know the key, you're trusted; if not, you're untrusted. That's a pretty coarse distinction. Here's an imaginary scenario. You have 5 friends who all have the shared key, and you're planning a surprise party for one of them. You want to send a message that can be read by everyone except the guy you're throwing the party for. A single shared key doesn't allow for that type of distinction. A better system would allow you to control which users can decrypt an encrypted message on a user-by-user basis.\n- Sender Authentication: If the secret key is shared by, say, 3 people, then you have a guarantee that if you receive an encrypted message, it came from one of those 3 people. But you don't have any assurances beyond that. If Alice, Bob, and Charlie all share a key, and Alice receives an encrypted message that seems to come from Bob, she can be sure that an untrusted person (like Dorothy) didn't spoof the message, but she can't be sure that a trusted person (like Charlie) didn't spoof it. A better system would provide for strong sender authentication to ensure that nobody can convincingly spoof a message.\n- Implementation: Home-grown systems tend to cut corners in their implementations. The above-referenced example solution is password-based, which almost certainly means that the derived encryption keys won't actually be as strong as they should be (most passwords don't have anywhere near the strength of a 128-bit encryption key), and it handles initialization vectors poorly. Whenever possible, it's better to use security protocols that were designed by people who actually know what they're doing, rather than growing your own.\nS/MIME is designed to solve all of these problems. It's a well-defined standard (RFC 2633), and it's implemented in all the major mail clients (although I only tested Outlook, Outlook Express, and Mozilla Thunderbird). It is not, however, natively supported by .NET. That's where this library comes in.\nI'm going to assume that you already know something about public-key cryptography in general, and about S/MIME in particular. I'm also going to assume that you already have a signing certificate for yourself (complete with private key), and the encryption certificates of anybody you want to send encrypted mail to (without the private key, of course). If you and your friends don't already have certificates, they're pretty easy to come by. I got my personal signing/encryption certificate from Verisign (at about $20/year, they're pretty cheap).\nUsing the Code\nThe object model was designed to resemble the\nSystem.Net.Mail classes pretty closely, so you should find it to be pretty intuitive. The primary differences just involve certificate handling.\nIf you're going to send a signed message, you need to create a\nSecureMailAddress that has a signing cert associated with it. Your cert will either be in the certificate store, or it'll be in a file (like a .pfx file). If you're reading the certificate out of a file, the code to create a\nSecureMailAddress for the sender will look something like this:\nX509Certificate2 myCert =\nnew X509Certificate2(@\"c:\\certs\\myCert.pfx\", \"SomeSecretPassword\");\nReading a certificate out of the cert store is a bit more work, so I've included a helper method to do it for you. Just specify the serial number, and it'll retrieve the certificate from your local store.\nX509Certificate2 myCertFromStore = CryptoHelper.FindCertificate(\"1B37D3\");\nOnce you've loaded your certificates, you need to attach them to a\nSecureMailAddress, like this:\nSecureMailAddress senderAddress = new SecureMailAddress\n(\"email@example.com\", \"Alice\", aliceEncryptionCert, aliceSigningCert);\nSecureMailAddress recipientAddress = new SecureMailAddress\n(\"firstname.lastname@example.org\", \"Bob\", bobEncryptionCert);\nNotice that we specified a signing cert for the sender, but we only need one if we're planning on sending a signed message. For all the recipients, we only need the encryption certs. Also note that we need to specify the sender's encryption cert when we send an encrypted message, in addition to each of the recipients' encryption certs. If we didn't, then the sender wouldn't be able to read his own message, even though he's the one who sent it.\nSecureMailMessage class supports most of the stuff that the regular\nSystem.Net.Mail.MailMessage class can do. You can CC and Bcc recipients, set a ReplyTo address, send attachments, and send HTML mail. Here's a full example which demonstrates, front-to-back, how to send a signed and encrypted message.\nSecureMailMessage message = new SecureMailMessage();\nX509Certificate2 signingCert = CryptoHelper.FindCertificate(\"1B37D3\");\nX509Certificate2 encryptionCert = CryptoHelper.FindCertificate(\"22C590\");\nX509Certificate2 recipientCert = new X509Certificate2(@\"c:\\certs\\bob.cer\");\nmessage.From = new SecureMailAddress\n(\"email@example.com\", \"Alice\", encryptionCert, signingCert);\n(\"firstname.lastname@example.org\", \"Bob\", recipientCert));\nmessage.Subject = \"This is a signed and encrypted message\";\nmessage.Body = \"<h2>Sent from the Cpi.Net.SecureMail library!</h2>\";\nmessage.IsBodyHtml = true;\nmessage.IsSigned = true;\nmessage.IsEncrypted = true;\nSystem.Net.Mail.SmtpClient client =\nnew System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient(\"mymailserver\", 25);\nclient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(\"YourSmtpUserName\", \"YourSmtpPassword\");\nNotice that you can use the regular\nSystem.Net.Mail.SmtpClient class to send the message. That's because the\nSecureMailMessage class has an implicit casting operator which turns it into a\n- This library signs, encrypts, and formats the message in accordance with RFC 2633, but it's important to note that I didn't personally implement the actual cryptographic stuff involved in the signing and encryption. (I'm not qualified to implement cryptographic algorithms securely. Neither are you, in all likelihood. Don't try it.) The cryptographic stuff is handled by the classes in the\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs namespace, which was introduced in .NET 2.0. Thanks, Microsoft, for doing a lot of the heavy lifting here.\n- The library is, to the best of my knowledge, a compliant implementation of RFC 2633, but it isn't a complete implementation. It implements all of the MUSTs in the RFC, but not all of the SHOULDs. This means that any compliant mail client should be able to read the messages that this library sends. (It's been tested in Outlook, Outlook Express, and Mozilla Thunderbird.)\n- I built this library partially by reading the appropriate specifications, and partially by setting up a homegrown TCP proxy and snooping on the traffic that existing mail clients send. (The TCP proxy isn't ready for prime-time, but it'll probably make an appearance in a future article.) There are some places in the spec that allow certain freedoms to individual implementations (such as whether to sign first, then encrypt, or encrypt first, then sign. The spec allows arbitrarily nested layers of signing and encryption.) In these cases, I just copied what the existing implementations do. (In this particular case, sign first, then encrypt.)\n- One of the constructors for\nSecureMailMessage accepts both a signing certificate and an encryption certificate. It's possible that you have a single certificate that you use for both signing and encryption. (That's how my personal certificate works.) The reason that they're separated into two separate parameters is because some organizations (like my workplace) issue separate certificates for signing and encryption. That way, the organization can keep a backup of your encryption certificate (so they can read your mail if you quit, or die, or if they just feel like it), but they don't keep a backup of your signing certificate (because if they did, then a malicious sysadmin could still send mail signed as you, which defeats the whole purpose of cryptographic signatures). If you have separate certificates for signing and encryption, then supply both of them to the corresponding\nSecureMailAddress constructor parameters. If you only have one, though, just supply it as both the signing cert and the encryption cert.\n- This is a pretty serious topic, and is closely related to the type of stuff I do professionally, so I've treated it a bit more seriously than some of my previous articles, which were just for fun. (There are, for example, no toy airplanes or dead fish.) Sorry about that.\n- Whenever you talk about cryptography, there's a standard set of imaginary users that you reference (Alice, Bob, Charlie, etc.) in your examples. I'll admit that I sometimes feel closer to these imaginary people than I do to my own friends and co-workers. (Except for Mallory, of course...I hate her so much!)\n- August 23, 2009 - Initial posting\n- February 19, 2010 - Fixed a bug which prevented non-ASCII characters from being encoded correctly in encrypted e-mail\n- March 12, 2010 - Fixed a bug which caused a\nNullReferenceException if you sent a message with an empty body\n- July 14, 2010 - Fixed a bug which caused certain messages to become corrupted if any lines start with a period.

{"text": "OpenVMS User's Manual\n1.3.2 Changing Your Initial Password\nLog in to your account soon after it is created to change your\npassword. If there is a time lapse from the moment your account is\ncreated until your first login, other users might log in to your\naccount successfully, gaining a chance to damage the system. Similarly,\nif you neglect to change the password or are unable to do so, the\nsystem remains vulnerable. Possible damage depends largely on what\nother security measures are in effect. See Section 1.7 for more\ninformation on changing passwords.\n1.3.3 Restrictions on Passwords\nThe system screens passwords for acceptability, as follows:\n- It automatically compares new passwords to a system dictionary.\nThis helps to ensure that a password is not a native language word.\n- It maintains a history list of your old passwords and compares each\nnew password to this list to be sure that you do not reuse a password.\n- It enforces a minimum password length, which the system manager\nspecifies in your UAF record.\nThe system rejects any passwords that it finds in a system dictionary,\nthat you have used before, and that are shorter than the minimum\npassword length specified in your UAF.\n1.3.4 Types of Passwords\nThere are several types of passwords recognized by the OpenVMS\n- User password\nRequired for most accounts. After entering your user name, you are\nprompted for a password. If the account requires both primary and\nsecondary passwords, two passwords must be entered.\n- System password\nControls access to particular terminals and is required at the\ndiscretion of the security administrator. System passwords are usually\nnecessary to control access to terminals that might be targets for\nunauthorized use, such as dialup and public terminal lines.\n- Primary password\nThe first of two passwords to be entered for an account requiring\nboth primary and secondary passwords.\n- Secondary password\nThe second of two passwords to be entered for an account requiring\nboth primary and secondary passwords. The secondary password provides\nan additional level of security on user accounts.\nTypically, the primary user does not know the secondary password; a\nsupervisor or other key person must be present to supply it. For\ncertain applications, the supervisor may also decide to remain present\nwhile the account is in use. Thus, secondary passwords facilitate\ncontrolled logins and the actions taken after a login.\nSecondary passwords can be time-consuming and inconvenient. They\nare justified only at sites with maximum security requirements. An\nexample of an account that justifies dual passwords would be one that\nbypasses normal access controls to permit emergency repair to a\n1.3.5 Entering a System Password\nYour security administrator will tell you if you must specify a system\npassword to log in to one or more of the terminals designated for your\nuse. Ask your security administrator for the current system password,\nhow often it changes, and how to obtain the new system password when it\nTo specify a system password, do the following:\nPress the Enter key until the terminal responds with the recognition\ncharacter, which is commonly a bell.\nType the system password and press Enter. There is no prompt and the\nsystem does not display the characters you type. If you fail to specify\nthe correct system password, the system does not notify you.\n(Initially, you might think the system is malfunctioning unless you\nknow that a system password is required at that terminal.) If you do\nnot receive a response from the system, assume that you have entered\nthe wrong password and try again.\nWhen you enter the correct system password, you receive the system\nannouncement message, if there is one, followed by the Username:\nprompt. For example:\nMAPLE - A member of the Forest Cluster\nUnauthorized Access is Prohibited\n1.3.6 Entering a Secondary Password\nYour security administrator decides whether to require the use of\nsecondary passwords for your account at the time your account is\ncreated. When your account requires primary and secondary passwords,\nyou need two passwords to log in. Minimum password length, which the\nsecurity administrator specifies in your UAF, applies to both passwords.\nAs with a single password login, the system allots a limited amount of\ntime for the entire login. If you do not enter a secondary password in\ntime, the login period expires.\nThe following example shows a login that requires primary and secondary\nWILLOW - A member of the Forest Cluster\nWelcome to OpenVMS on node WILLOW\nLast interactive login on Friday, 11-DEC-2002 10:22\n1.3.7 Password Requirements for Different Types of Accounts\nFour types of user accounts are available on OpenVMS systems:\n- Accounts secured with passwords that you or the security\nadministrator change periodically. This account type is the most common.\n- Accounts that always require passwords but prohibit you from\nchanging the password. By locking the password (setting the LOCKPWD\nflag in the UAF), the security administrator controls all changes made\nto the password.\n- Restricted accounts limit your use of the system\nand sometimes require a password.\nOpen accounts require no password. When you log in to\nan open account, the system does not prompt you for a password and you\ndo not need to enter one. You can begin entering commands immediately.\nBecause open accounts allow anyone to gain access to the system, they\nare used only at sites with minimal security requirements.\n1.4 Reading Informational Messages\nWhen you log in from a terminal that is directly connected to a\ncomputer, the OpenVMS system displays informational system messages, as\nshown in the following example.\nWILLOW - A member of the Forest Cluster (1)\nUnlawful Access is Prohibited\nYou have the following disconnected process: (2)\nTerminal Process name Image name\nVT320: RWOODS (none)\nConnect to above listed process [YES]: NO\nWelcome to OpenVMS on node WILLOW (3)\nLast interactive login on Wednesday, 11-DEC-2002 10:20 (4)\nLast non-interactive login on Monday, 30-NOV-2002 17:39 (5)\n2 failures since last successful login (6)\nYou have 1 new mail message. (7)\nNote the following about the example:\nThe announcement message identifies the node (and, if relevant, the\nOpenVMS Cluster name). It may also warn unauthorized users that\nunlawful access is prohibited. The system manager or security\nadministrator can control both the appearance and the content of this\nA disconnected process message informs you that your process was\ndisconnected at some time after your last successful login but is still\navailable. You have the option of reconnecting to the old process, in\nthe state it was in before you were disconnected.\ndisplays the disconnected message only when the following conditions\n- The terminal where the interruption occurred is set up as a virtual\n- Your terminal is set up as one that can be disconnected.\n- During a recent session, your connection to the central processing\nunit (CPU) through that terminal was broken before you logged out.\nIn general, the security administrator should allow you to reconnect\nbecause this ability poses no special problems for system security.\nHowever, the security administrator can disable this function by\nchanging the setup on terminals and by disabling virtual terminals on\nthe system. (For information on setting up and reconnecting to virtual\nterminals, refer to the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.)\n- A welcome message indicates the version number\nof the OpenVMS operating system that is running and the name of the\nnode on which you are logged in. The system manager can choose a\ndifferent message or can suppress the message entirely.\n- The last successful interactive login message\nprovides the time of the last completed login for a local, dialup, or\nremote login. (The system does not count logins from a subprocess whose\nparent was one of these types.)\n- The last successful noninteractive login\nmessage provides the time the last noninteractive (batch or network)\nThe number of login failure messages indicates the number of failed\nattempts at login. (An incorrect password is the only source of login\nfailure that is counted.) To attract your attention, a bell rings after\nthe message appears.\n- The new mail message indicates if you have any\nunread mail messages.\n1.4.1 Suppressing Messages\nA security administrator can suppress the announcement and welcome\nmessages, which include node names and operating system identification.\nBecause login procedures differ according to operating system, it is\nmore difficult to log in without this information.\nThe last login success and failure messages are optional. Your security\nadministrator can enable or disable them as a group. Sites with\nmedium-level or high-level security needs display these messages\nbecause they can indicate break-in attempts. In addition, by showing\nthat the system is monitoring logins, these messages can be a deterrent\nto potential illegal users.\n1.4.2 Successful Login Messages\nEach time you log in, the system resets the values for the last\nsuccessful login and the number of login failures. If you access your\naccount interactively and do not specify an incorrect password in your\nlogin attempts, you may not see the last successful noninteractive\nlogin and login failure messages.\n1.5 Types of Logins and Login Classes\nLogins can be either interactive or noninteractive. When you log in\ninteractively, you enter a user name and a password. In noninteractive\nlogins, the system performs the identification and authentication for\nyou; you are not prompted for a user name and password.\nIn addition to interactive and noninteractive logins, the OpenVMS\noperating system recognizes different classes of logins. How you log in\nto the system determines the login class to which you\nbelong. Based on your login class, as well as the time of day or day of\nthe week, the system manager controls your access to the system.\n1.5.1 Interactive Logins\nInteractive logins include the following login classes:\nYou log in from a terminal connected directly to the central\nprocessor or from a terminal server that communicates directly with the\nYou log in to a terminal that uses a modem and a telephone line to\nmake a connection to the computer system. Depending on the terminal\nthat your system uses, you might need to execute a few additional steps\ninitially. Your site security administrator can give you the necessary\nYou log in to a node over the network by entering the DCL command\nSET HOST. For example, to access the remote node HUBBUB, you enter the\nIf you have access to an account on node HUBBUB, you can log in to\nthat account from your local node. You have access to the facilities on\nnode HUBBUB, but you remain physically connected to your local node.\nFor additional information on remote sessions, see Section 1.12.2.\n1.5.2 Noninteractive Logins\nNoninteractive logins include the following:\n- Network Logins\nThe system performs a network login when you initiate a network\ntask on a remote node, such as displaying the contents of a directory\nor copying files stored in a directory on another node. Both your\ncurrent system and the remote system must be nodes in the same network.\nIn the file specification, you identify the target node and provide an\naccess control string, which includes your user name and password for\nthe remote node.\nFor example, a network login occurs when user\nGREG, who has an account on remote node PARIS, enters the following\n$ DIRECTORY PARIS\"GREG 8G4FR93A\"::WORK2:[PUBLIC]*.*;*\nThis command displays a listing of all the files in the public\ndirectory on disk WORK2. It also reveals the password 8G4FR93A. A more\nsecure way to perform the same task would be to use a proxy account on\nnode PARIS. For an example of a proxy login, see\n- Batch Logins\nThe system performs a batch login when a batch job that you\nsubmitted runs. Authorization to build the job is\ndetermined at the time the job is submitted. When the system prepares\nto execute the job, the job controller creates a noninteractive process\nthat logs in to your account. No password is required when the job logs\n1.6 Login Failures\nLogins can fail for any number of reasons. One of your passwords might\nhave changed or your account might have expired. You might be\nattempting to log in over the network or from a modem but be\nunauthorized to do so. The following table summarizes common reasons\nfor login failure:\nNo response from the terminal\nA defective terminal, a terminal that requires a system password, or a\nterminal that is not powered on.\nNo response from any terminal\nThe system is down.\nNo response from the terminal when you enter the system password\nThe system password changed.\n\"User authorization failure\"\nA typing error in your user name or password.\nThe account or password expired.\n\"Not authorized to log in from this source\"\nYour particular class of login (local, dialup, remote, interactive,\nbatch, or network) is prohibited.\n\"Not authorized to log in at this time\"\nYou do not have access to log in during this hour or this day of the\n\"User authorization failure\" (and no known user failure occurred)\nAn apparent break-in has been attempted at the terminal using your user\nname, and the system has temporarily disabled all logins at that\nterminal by your user name.\nThe following sections describe the reasons for login failure in more\n1.6.1 Terminals That Require System Passwords\nYou cannot log in if the terminal you attempt to use requires a system\npassword and you are unaware of the requirement. All attempts at\nlogging in fail until you enter the system password.\nIf you know the system password, perform the steps described in\nSection 1.3.5. If your attempts fail, it is possible that the system\npassword has been changed. If you do not know the system password and\nyou suspect that this is the problem, try to log in at another terminal\nor request the new system password.\n1.6.2 Login Class Restrictions\nIf you attempt a class of login that is prohibited in your UAF record,\nyour login will fail. For example, your security administrator can\nrestrict you from logging in over the network. If you attempt a network\nlogin, you receive a message telling you that you are not authorized to\nlog in from this source.\nYour security administrator can restrict your logins to include or\nexclude any of the following classes: local, remote, dialup, batch, or\n1.6.3 Shift Restrictions\nAnother cause of login difficulty is failure to observe your shift\nrestrictions. A system manager or security administrator can control\naccess to the system based on the time of day or the day of the week.\nThese restrictions are imposed on classes of logins. The security\nadministrator can apply the same work-time restrictions to all classes\nof logins or choose to place different restrictions on different login\nIf you attempt a login during a time prohibited for that login class,\nyour login fails. The system notifies you that you are not authorized\nto log in at this time.\n1.6.4 Batch Jobs During Shift Restrictions\nWhen shift restrictions apply to batch jobs, jobs you submit that are\nscheduled to run outside your permitted work times are not run. The\nsystem does not automatically resubmit such jobs during your next\navailable permitted work time. Similarly, if you have initiated any\nkind of job and attempt to run it beyond your permitted time periods,\nthe job controller aborts the uncompleted job when the end of your\nallocated work shift is reached. This job termination behavior applies\nto all jobs.\n1.6.5 Failures During Dialup Logins\nYour security administrator can control the number of opportunities you\nare given to enter a correct password during a dialup login before the\nconnection is automatically broken.\nIf your login fails and you have attempts remaining, press the Enter\nkey and try again. You can do this until you succeed or reach the\nlimit. If the connection is lost, you can redial the access line and\nThe typical reason for limiting the number of dialup login failures is\nto discourage unauthorized users attempting to learn passwords by trial\nand error. They already have the advantage of anonymity because of the\ndialup line. Of course, limiting the number of tries for each dialup\ndoes not necessarily stop this kind of break-in attempt. It only\nrequires the perpetrator to redial and start another login.\n1.6.6 Break-In Evasion Procedures\nIf anyone has made a number of failed attempts to log in at the same\nterminal with your user name, the system can respond as though a\nbreak-in attempt is in progress. That is, the system\nconcludes that someone is attempting to gain illegal access to the\nsystem by using your user name.\nAt the discretion of your security administrator, break-in evasion\nmeasures can be in effect for all users of the system. The security\nadministrator controls how many password attempts are allowed over what\nperiod of time. Once break-in evasion tactics are triggered, you cannot\nlog in to the terminal---even with your correct password---during a\ndefined interval. Your security administrator can tell you how long you\nmust wait before reattempting the login, or you can move to another\nterminal to attempt a login.\nIf you suspect that break-in evasion is preventing your login and you\nhave not personally experienced any login failures, contact your\nsecurity administrator immediately. Together, you should attempt\nanother login and check the message that reveals the number of login\nfailures since the last login to confirm or deny your suspicion of\nbreak-in attempts. (If your system does not normally display the login\nmessage, your security administrator can use the Authorize utility\n(AUTHORIZE) to examine the data in your UAF record.) With prompt\naction, your security administrator can locate someone attempting\nlogins at another terminal.\n1.7 Changing Passwords\nChanging passwords on a regular basis promotes system security. To\nchange your password, enter the DCL command SET PASSWORD.\nThe system manager can allow you to select a password on your own or\ncan require that you use the automatic password generator when you\nchange your password. If you select your own password, note that the\npassword must follow system restrictions on length and acceptability\n(see Section 1.3.3).\nThere is no restriction on how many times you can change your password\nin a given period of time.\nThe following example shows a password choice that is too short:\n$ SET PASSWORD\n%SET-F-INVPWDLEN, password length must be between 12 and 32\ncharacters; password not changed", "label": 1}
{"text": "Preliminary Report Shows \"Cloud\" Computing Technology Should Make Sharing Medical Images Easier and More Efficient\nMount Sinai was the first site to go live in August 2011 and currently has about 190 patients enrolled in project.\nPatients find \"cloud\" technology a faster, more efficient way to store and distribute their medical images than current options, according to the preliminary findings of an image sharing project led by The Mount Sinai Medical Center in conjunction with four other academic medical institutions. The Phase I results of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Image Share project are being presented today at the American Roentgen Ray Society Annual Meeting in Vancouver, Canada.\nMount Sinai was the first site to go live in August 2011 and currently has about 190 patients enrolled in project. A total of about 600 patients are participating in all sites, which also include University of California - San Francisco, University of Chicago Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, and the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.\n\"Cloud\" computing involves using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.\n\"This is the next revolution in digital imaging,\" said David Mendelson, MD, FACR, Chief of Clinical Informatics at The Mount Sinai Medical Center and Chief Clinical Investigator for RSNA Image Share. \"It gives the patient ownership over their records and makes the information more accessible to physicians. Plus it decreases unnecessary radiation exposure that can be caused by physicians ordering duplicate examinations due to records not being easily available.\"\nTo use RSNA Image Share, patients create an account and password and then are given access to import their images and reports into the personal health record account. For patient confidentiality and security reasons, when the information leaves the server at each local radiology site and goes outside a hospital's firewall, it remains encrypted until it arrives in the patient’s account, where it's unencrypted so the patient can see it.\n\"We're dealing with sensitive health information, so creating a secure and confidential system is of the utmost importance,\" said Dr. Mendelson. \"But if you look at online banking or shopping, which both transport sensitive financial information; we know creating a secure, widely used system is an attainable goal.\"\nIn phase two of the trial, patients will be allowed to share their images without the images first being uploaded to an Internet-based personal health record. This should be useful in the event of severe acute trauma, with transfer to a trauma center. In phase three, the data will be de-identified and then made available for clinical trials.\nThe RSNA Image Share project was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at NIH.\nAbout The Mount Sinai Medical Center\nThe Mount Sinai Medical Center encompasses both The Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Established in 1968, Mount Sinai School of Medicine is one of the leading medical schools in the United States. The Medical School is noted for innovation in education, biomedical research, clinical care delivery, and local and global community service. It has more than 3,400 faculty in 32 departments and 14 research institutes, and ranks among the top 20 medical schools both in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding and by U.S. News & World Report.\nThe Mount Sinai Hospital, founded in 1852, is a 1,171-bed tertiary- and quaternary-care teaching facility and one of the nation’s oldest, largest and most-respected voluntary hospitals. In 2011, U.S. News & World Report ranked The Mount Sinai Hospital 16th on its elite Honor Roll of the nation’s top hospitals based on reputation, safety, and other patient-care factors. Of the top 20 hospitals in the United States, Mount Sinai is one of 12 integrated academic medical centers whose medical school ranks among the top 20 in NIH funding and U.S. News & World Report and whose hospital is on the U.S. News & World Report Honor Roll. Nearly 60,000 people were treated at Mount Sinai as inpatients last year, and approximately 560,000 outpatient visits took place.\nFor more information, visit http://www.mountsinai.org/.", "label": 1}
{"text": "3.1 Data Theft?\nData theft occurs when a fraudster steals identifying information--names, addresses, financial data--from an unsuspecting victim and sells the information or uses it for personal gain. Keyloggers can skim Web users' e-mail addresses and passwords by using software that surreptitiously captures the keystrokes they type, for example. Phishing scams use bogus e-mails and Web sites that seem legitimate but are actually designed to trick users into revealing personal and financial information. Computer criminals can then use the data to spy on or blackmail users, hijack their online accounts (including bank accounts), spread rumors, or operate under the victim's identity.\nAlthough minors don't risk as much financial loss as adults, they are in danger of exposure to interlopers aiming to hijack or share their online identity. Children are especially vulnerable because they're often unable to identify and report data-snatching malware, and because they tend to be less cautious about sharing sensitive information with strangers and friends.\n- Long, hard-to-guess passwords that include a mix of numbers, letters, and characters\n- Do not disclose passwords to friends and strangers\n- Know how to identify malicious software\nMalicious software--or malware--is the umbrella term for unsolicited software intended to annoy, destroy, or exploit. The category includes malicious adware, viruses, keylogging software, and backdoor Trojan programs, which allow attackers unauthorized access to and control over a user's computer. Malicious software often loads through infected links and downloads when users click on ads or buttons designed to launch the programs. The links and buttons may be presented to an intended victim via phishing e-mail or on a malicious Web site. Malware can sometimes load invisibly and, in a worst-case scenario, allow others to control your computer. It's a good idea to become familiar with security terms and what danger each security threat poses.\nKids often value \"free\" over \"safe\". Young surfers involved in link-sharing and file-sharing among peers are at higher risk of downloading infected programs. Malware distributors know kids seek out free software, music, and \"cracks\" (serial numbers) for pirating commercial games; they also know these same kids often trust links and e-mail attachments far more than they should.\n- Teach kids to be extremely cautious when opening downloads or links from friends and strangers\n- Never click ads or answer unsolicited e-mails\n- Teach kids to refrain from automatically clicking \"yes\" buttons anywhere on the screen--read all text carefully\n- Download legitimate software only, and only from trusted sites. Software is available that can help spot the bogus software offers\n- Kids should immediately report anything suspicious to an adult\n3.3 Inappropriate Content\nWhat's inappropriate for a minor? That's largely a matter of common sense and, depending on the age of their child, varies from parent to parent. Some countries ban adult content for all users, while in the U.S. school libraries receiving federal funds are obliged to block online access to such content.\nRisk and defense\nEven if a minor isn't looking for adult or violent material online, it's sometimes easy to stumble across it simply by following search-engine or instant-message links.\nScammers, meanwhile, often use pornographic pop-ups to lure users into clicking links that load malicious software. Parents often rely on content-blocking and filtering software to limit what kids can see, but be forewarned that older kids with computer skills are often adept at working around such controls.\nIt's frightening and hurtful when bullies taunt and deride their peers at the schoolyard. It can be even more damaging when it happens online. Cyberbullying includes threats, gossip, and insults that are spread via e-mail and IM, broadcast on social networking sites, planted in forums, and distributed through community-oriented online games.\nRisk and defense\nSadly, there's no easy way to protect children from determined bullies, online or offline. The best defense is early detection (does your child become anxious when going online or answering the cell phone?) and knowing your options. For example, Roland Park Country School, a K-12 school for girls in Baltimore, cites examples of cyberbullying (\"A girl gets e-mail every day after school from an anonymous person who calls her the fattest, stupidest, ugliest girl who ever lived\") and offers good advice on what to do if the harassment escalates. Specific tips also are available through the About.com Web portal.\n- Emphasize that kids should talk to an adult if they become victims of bullying\n- Save the evidence\n- Report incidents to your Internet service provider, e-mail provider, or Web site host. If the incidents begin occurring offline, report the encounters to the bully's parents or to school officials\nEvery parent's worst Web nightmare, online predators are most commonly adults who use various techniques to establish a close relationship with young Web users.\nPredators typically pose as young people and take their time befriending minors, gathering personal information and other clues in the virtual world so they can lure, blackmail, abuse or kidnap their targets in the real world.\nYoung \"netizens\" become susceptible to predators when they chat online with strangers and make photos and personal details publicly accessible. Predators use clues about their vulnerabilities and whereabouts to get emotionally and physically close.\nNumerous organizations provide tips for keeping kids aware of and away from suspicious online strangers. Guidelines include staying private online and using parental control software. Just as important, parents should discuss the tactics and dangers posed by online predators openly and honestly with kids and teens.\n- What is Yahoo!?\n- Facebook Facts\n- Facebook Finally Makes Money\n- Facebook & Your Privacy\n- What is Google?\n- Google Pagerank Facts\n- Google's Quantum Algorithm\n- Internet Addiction Facts\n- MySpace Facts\n- What made Amazon.com so Big?\n- Twitter Facts\n- 10 signs of Twitter Addiction\n- What are Cookies?\n- What's a Browser?\n- What is Surfing the Net?\n- What is Phishing?\n- What's Spam?\n- What's Malware?\n- What's an Internet Virus?\n- What's a Trojan Horse?\n- What are Blended Threats?\n- What's the best way to protect your computer from Viruses, Worms and Trojan Horses?\n- What's Spyware?\n- What's Adware?\n- What is Rogue Anti-virus Software?\n- What is a Temporary Internet File?\n- What are LANs, WANs & ISPs?\n- What's a Protocol?\n- What are Routers & Modems?\n- What is Affiliate Marketing?\n- What's a Server?\n- What are Software and Hardware?\n- Set up your Profile\n- Follow People with Similar Interests\n- Get into the Conversation\n- Don't Spam\n- Update Daily\n- Find the Biggest Buzz and Contribute\n- Help other People out\n- Create Relationships\n- Integrate Twitter with other Social Networks\n- Establish Relationships even outside Twitter\n- The History of EBay\n- The History of Amazon.com\n- The History of Facebook\n- The History of Twitter\n- The History of Google\n- The History of Yahoo!\n- The History of Wikipedia", "label": 1}
{"text": "Read Part 2 of this article.\nSince the turn of the century, wireless networking has grown from a very exclusive tech toy into a full-blown phenomenon. For less than $50, anyone who can plug in a toaster can essentially set up a wireless local area network (WLAN). The problem with this plug-and-play generation of users is that very few understand how their data is sent through the air, much less comprehend the associated risks. Even as I write this, an estimated 40–50% of all wireless users are not implementing any form of protection. On the bright side, this percentage is falling, albeit very slowly.\nThe security problem is exacerbated by the fact that early attempts at encryption were flawed. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was found to be vulnerable to various statistical weaknesses in the encryption algorithm it employed to scramble data passed over the WLAN. While attempts were made to correct the problem, it's still a relatively simple feat to crack WEP and essentially pull the password right out of the air. In addition, WEP suffers from other problems that make it unacceptable for use in any secure environment.\nThe wireless community knew early on that these problems existed. However, they also realized that it would take years until the standardized correction was designed and implemented into new hardware. In the meantime, millions of users needed reliable protection. The Wi-Fi Alliance stepped up to the challenge and created an interim \"standard\" called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).\nWPA did an excellent job of patching the problems in WEP. With only a software upgrade, it corrected almost every security problem either created or ignored by WEP. However, WPA also created new problems:\n- One flaw allowed an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack, if the attacker could bypass several other layers of protection.\n- A second flaw exists in the method with which WPA initializes its encryption scheme. Consequently, it's actually easier to crack WPA than it is to crack WEP. This flaw is the subject of this article.", "label": 1}
{"text": "What is IP VPN\nA Virtual Private Network ( VPN) delivers private network services over a public infrastructure. An IP VPN is a partitioned private network constructed over a shared IP-based backbone that utilizes technologies to ensure privacy of data. They offer enterprise-class scalability and reachability across multiple IP-based infrastructures, along with many of the performance and security characteristics traditionally found only in dedicated private environments.\nMPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) technology based VPNs combines the intelligence of private IP routing with the added performance of label switching to move packets between any location on the network. With only one access link to the MPLS \"cloud\" from each of your locations, full mesh connectivity will improve your network scalability, reliability, and internal network application performance.\nMPLS also provides a greater degree of security for voice and other types of business traffic since each VPN is a virtually separated network infrastructure over the SLT's MPLS IP Backbone.\nSLT IP VPN gives you choices in your network design of sophisticated VPN technologies, access, security and voice, with the flexibility to add on options such as remote access and hosting in IDC (Internet Data Centre).", "label": 1}
{"text": "What Is Identity Theft, Anyway?\nJerome Powell remembers being irritated with himself for not paying closer attention to his driving. When the Mountain View, Colorado, police car’s blue lights came on behind him, Powell, a government contractor, had just driven through a yellow light as it turned red. Now he would be late for his next appointment. He apologized to the officer and handed over his driver’s license and insurance information. He watched in his rearview mirror as the officer radioed from his cruiser for a license check.\nIt seemed to be taking a long time to write a routine ticket. Finally, the officer approached Powell’s window and told him to get out of the car. Powell was stunned to find himself under arrest on two outstanding felony warrants. He was shocked and humiliated as the officer made him put his hands behind his back and then cuffed him and read him his Miranda rights. The Navy veteran spent hours in jail, shaking from fear that he might wind up charged with a crime he didn’t commit.\nThe warrants for his arrest were issued in 2003, when a thief used Powell’s driver’s license to buy more than $10,000 in computer equipment and other items. Despite overwhelming evidence that it was a case of identity theft—the stolen goods were delivered to the apartment of a career criminal who bore no resemblance at all to Powell—he was forced to spend several thousand dollars to post bond and get a lawyer to clear his name.\nJerome Powell’s unnerving and expensive experience is a true case of identity theft—the thief used Powell’s driver’s license to impersonate Powell. Not to be picky about it, but what the media and most people call “identity theft” is actually an umbrella term for two different crimes: identity theft and identity fraud. As in Powell’s case, identity theft occurs when criminals steal personal information and use it to impersonate the victim. An illegal immigrant using a stolen Social Security card to get a job is a good example of such an impersonation, as is a driver who has lost his or her license because of multiple convictions for driving while intoxicated and buys a fake driver’s license from an underground dealer containing the name and information of an identity-theft victim. True identity theft accounts for about a third of the 685,000 identity crime complaints reported to the Federal Trade Commission in 2005.\nFar more common is identity fraud. It happens when thieves obtain a victim’s sensitive personal information to steal money from bank accounts, buy goods and services with existing credit-card accounts or use the data to open new credit lines. The shocking thing is that these types of criminals are frequently people we know. Such betrayals by family or close friends are emotionally draining and almost certainly underreported since victims often find it difficult to report the crime or feel pressured by family members to keep the theft quiet.\nNot Abigail Kelly. Abigail had given her Social Security number to her sister Delia after Delia said she was going to make Abigail the beneficiary of her life-insurance policy. Delia promptly used Abigail’s information to open fraudulent credit and utility accounts. As a result, Abigail not only suffered damage to her credit history, but she didn’t get the job after an employee background check turned up an arrest warrant for an unpaid home heating bill in her name in Maine. Abigail had never even been to Maine. But Delia lived there. Abigail later learned that her sister was behind numerous accounts opened in her name, though Delia wasn’t arrested or charged with any crime. Local law enforcement refused to get involved in what looked like a family dispute, so Abigail wound up suing her sister in civil court instead. After Abigail sued her, Delia finally agreed to pay most of the $50,000, but the incident tore their relationship apart. “You are dead to me,” Delia later told Abigail.\nRoutine one-on-one crimes are the most common and are largely ignored by the media and, unfortunately, many times by law enforcement. It’s the big-time scams and plots that get the attention. In August 2005, employees at Sunbelt Software Inc. stumbled upon a massive identity- theft ring while researching “CoolWebSearch,” a dangerous software program that hijacks Internet servers and Web home pages—as well as other browser applications. The software was routinely obtaining and broadcasting data such as individual names, bank-account numbers, passwords and PINs, and other extremely sensitive personal information from millions of infected computers. That investigation continues today.\nIt’s surprisingly easy to become an identity thief or fraudster by joining the ranks of criminals who simply buy the information from any number of legal or illegal sellers of sensitive consumer data. Once little-known to most Americans, the data-broking industry burst into the spotlight in February 2005, when ChoicePoint, a seller of consumer data to financial institutions and government agencies, disclosed that criminals posing as legitimate businesspeople had purchased personal information on 145,000 people. (Later, the figure was revised to 162,000.) Americans were staggered by the types of personal information being sold by ChoicePoint, including their names, their spouses’ names, current and previous addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, names of employers and even information about family members and neighbors. While individuals can sometimes buy such data legally, most legitimate data brokers sell only to corporate customers. But the fact that there’s no regulation of legal data sales means it’s easier for criminals to get their hands on your information.\nCOMPANIES RESPOND TO DATA BREACHES\nHere’s a sampling of what some specific companies and organizations have offered to do in response to disclosures that sensitive consumer information was lost or stolen from their databases.\nA contractor moving backup tapes discovered that one tape containing data, including many Social Security numbers, on 600,000 current and former employees, was missing. Time Warner offered a year of free credit-monitoring service.\nA Fidelity employee’s laptop, containing personal information on 196,000 current and former Hewlett-Packard workers, was stolen from a rental car. In response, the fund giant alerted credit-reporting agencies and offered free credit-monitoring service for a year to current and former HP employees.\nAdministrators discovered unusual activity on a university-owned computer with data, including some Social Security numbers, on 106,000 alumni. Tufts set up an 800 number for assistance and encouraged people to put alerts on their credit reports, but did not offer to pay for monitoring.\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nA laptop was stolen containing Social Security numbers belonging to 98,000 students, alumni and applicants. UC Berkeley set up a hotline and encouraged people to put alerts on their credit reports, but didn’t offer to pay for monitoring.\nFour computers containing sensitive personal data for thousands of people were stolen from a vendor that prints loan statements. Wells Fargo responded by offering a year of free credit monitoring using its own service.\nSource: The Wall Street Journal Online.\nOver the last five years, media coverage has increased as dozens of companies, universities, government agencies and other organizations have reported that vast amounts of sensitive consumer information was either lost or stolen. The list of companies that have reported lost or stolen consumer information reads like a “Who’s Who” of big business: Bank of America, Fidelity, Hewlett-Packard, Time Warner and Verizon, among others. In some instances, data-storage tapes went missing or laptops containing sensitive information were stolen; in others, employees of the companies or organizations obtained unauthorized access to the information. Even the federal government isn’t immune. In 2006, thieves stole data on about 26.5 million military personnel from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The laptop with the missing data was recovered a month after it was stolen, and two teens were arrested for the theft. But the department stumbled twice more, first when it canceled the credit-monitoring service it had offered the victims of the laptop theft, infuriating innumerable veterans who were counting on it to help protect the breach of their sensitive information. And then it happened again! Another department laptop disappeared. Needless to say, there are some decidedly unhappy vets wondering just how inept the department can get.\nNot surprisingly, victims are beginning to fight back in the courts against companies and organizations that report breaches of sensitive consumer data. In June 2006, a coalition of veterans groups filed a class-action suit against the federal government in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking $1,000 in damages for each of the roughly 26.5 million military personnel, both current and former, whose data was on the stolen laptop mentioned earlier. In July 2005, a group of plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit in California Superior against CardSystems Solutions Inc. after the company disclosed that computer hackers had obtained data on about 200,000 credit- and debit-card accounts.\nGARDEN VARIETY IDENTITY FRAUD\nI’ll get into some of the more exotic types of identity theft and fraud later. For the moment, let’s take a look at some of the most common forms of identity crimes. It isn’t hard to guess that by far the favored tool of identity thieves is the ubiquitous credit card. We all have them and we love to use them. So do identity thieves. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that 26 percent of all complaints of identity fraud in 2005 involved fraudulent charges on an existing account or new accounts opened using lost or stolen consumer information.\nHow easy is it to fall victim to credit-card fraud? Let me count the ways.\nWe use credit cards so often and in so many places—online and in person—that it is almost impossible to avoid tripping up and revealing your account information to a potential thief. I shudder to think of how careless I was with my credit-card account information before I discovered that I’d become the victim of identity fraud. I would routinely crumple up credit-card receipts containing my signature and entire account number and then casually toss them in the nearest trash receptacle for a would-be thief to snatch. When making travel reservations at work, I’d broadcast my credit-card number when giving it out to hotels or car-rental agencies, so that anyone within the sound of my voice could jot it down. When using ATMs, I worried more about the guy behind me invading my personal space than I did about whether the offending person was “shoulder surfing” to learn my account’s password. Online, I remembered— occasionally—to check to see if a site’s Web address started with the telltale “https://” and the tiny closed-padlock symbol at the bottom of the Web browser that indicated I was shopping at a secure site. I almost never checked sites such as the Better Business Bureau (www.bbbonline.org) and TRUSTe (www.truste.com) to ensure that the Web site I was using was a legitimate business.\nThen a phone call from my credit-card issuer made me aware of just how easy it is to fall victim to identity fraud. The company’s representative said the company noticed I’d made two purchases within hours of each other using my card—one in New York, the other in France. Fortunately for me, the card company put the purchases on hold until it could contact me and verify that I had made them. I was shocked—and a little scared. If my credit-card information had been stolen, what other personal information could the thief have?\nSo now I pay close attention to things like keeping my voice down when making travel reservations or making sure no one gets too close in the ATM line. I also routinely monitor my credit-card statements online for signs of fraudulent charges. When shopping online, I always use a credit card, rather than my debit card, which is attached to my checking account, because federal law limits liability for unauthorized credit-card use to $50 per card, though many companies will waive this amount if they are notified of the charge in a timely manner. Some debit cards don’t have this kind of zero- liability protection against fraud, but, more importantly, even if your bank offers zero-liability coverage on your checking account, it could take weeks to recover your account after a thief has wiped it out—and you could find yourself vulnerable to bounced-check fees on outstanding payments.\nCALLING ALL THIEVES\nAfter credit-card fraud, phone, cable and utilities fraud is the second most common form of identity theft, making up 18 percent of all complaints reported. Dishonest people steal personal information in order to apply for cell-phone contracts or improperly gain access to cable, telephone, gas and electric energy, or other types of utilities. It’s a difficult crime to combat, which is why it’s so popular among identity thieves. They open accounts in one place and then quickly move on to the next to avoid capture. By the time victims discover the crimes, the thief is usually long gone.\nKevin Scott of Philadelphia discovered he was the victim of utility fraud when he requested a copy of his credit report after being denied a loan. A thief had obtained Scott’s Social Security number and used it to open utility accounts at several addresses, racking up thousands of dollars in phone, cable, gas and electric bills. The utility companies allowed the criminal to open these accounts despite the fact that duplicate accounts already existed in Scott’s name at his true address. They also never bothered to contact him. He spent hundreds of hours clearing his good name at companies such as Bell Atlantic, Comcast Cablevision, PECO Energy and Philadelphia Gas Works. He was also frustrated because state and local law enforcers refused to help him track down the thief, despite the fact that authorities had his picture on file after the thief obtained a Pennsylvania driver’s license using Scott’s name.\nTAKE IT TO THE BANK\nBank fraud is only slightly less common than utilities fraud, which is surprising given that banks are among the more\nsecurity-conscious businesses—and fooling around with a bank can earn a thief a visit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Bank fraud accounts for 17 percent of reported identity-theft cases, with nearly 2 million Americans reporting that thieves transferred funds out of their checking accounts in 2004. The average loss per incident was $1,200. Fortunately, consumers rarely are left holding the bag. If the fraud is reported promptly, most banks won’t hold the customer liable for losses resulting from the crime. While fraudulent loans accounted for some bank fraud, the most frequent types of fraud involved electronic funds transfers and forged checks.\nMailboxes are the venue of choice for bank fraudsters. It isn’t difficult to recognize a box of checks sitting in a mailbox, although it takes a diligent thief to check dozens of mailboxes on any given day to find the occasional box of checks. More sophisticated thieves look for bill-payment envelopes left in the mailbox for pickup—then use special chemicals to erase the ink and insert different names.\nExcerpted from The Wall Street Journal.

{"text": "Personalised scams occur when scammers gather your personal information and use it to specifically target you with a scam. The fact that the scammer knows so much about you may make you think they are legitimate. These scams have become more common in recent years and have taken on a new dimension in the online environment.\nScammers target both individuals and businesses in this manner, leading their victims to believe that they have been specifically selected to receive an offer. In reality scammers will make the same offer to hundreds of other people. They often use the internet to gather personal information, for example through social networking websites and approach victims by phone, SMS, letter, email, fax, or through online networking, dating or chat services and blogs.\nScammers often trawl the internet for your personal details and have also been know to search your mailbox or recycling bin to get hold of discarded personal documents such as bank statements and bills.\nThe types of details which scammers search for include your:\ndate of birth\nemail address (personal and work)\ntelephone numbers (home, work and mobile)\nphysical address (home, work or postal address)\nbank account and credit card details\nsocial networking account, email account and online banking passwords\nother personal numbers, such as Tax File Numbers and Medicare numbers\nupcoming or current travel/holiday plans\nrelatives’ and friends’ names and contact details.\nIf scammers get hold of any of these details they may use them to pose as a legitimate government representative, a company, or a person you know and trust.\nRemember - Your personal details are private and invaluable – keep them that way.\nBe aware, in some cases scammers will simply use readily available public information such as your name and phone number from online directories and make educated guesses about you. For example, they may ask if you have a computer or an account with a specific bank – they pretend to know this about you but are simply guessing!\nIn this section\nView information on the following personalised scam types:\nSCAMwatch is warning Australians to erase their hard drive before parting with old computers and laptops. Simply deleting individual files is not enough to remove personal details, documents and passwords stored on the machine.\nGrooming occurs when a scammer tries to build a trusting relationship with you by making regular contact. Groomers use this relationship to extract greater amounts of money and/or sensitive personal and financial information from their victim.\nPharming is when you are redirected to a fake version of a website which may look identical to the website you were trying to view. The scammer will use the fake site to gather your sensitive personal information which they may then use to commit identity fraud.\nSocial networking websites allow you to create your own profile and to interact with your friends and other online users. Scammers also use social networking sites to steal personal information and trick people out of their money.\nVictim lists are directories of people who have previously responded to an offer or fallen victim to a scam. These lists are created by scammers and contain personal information and contact details. They are compiled for the purpose of approaching those listed with other scams.\nWhaling or spear phishing occurs when scammers personally target employees in order to steal confidential business information and money. Scammers send emails about fake business matters aiming to convince their victims to follow a link to a scam website and provide confidential and financial details.", "label": 1}
{"text": "OAuth (used by the likes of Twitter and others) is a protocol designed to negate the need for users to give 3rd-parties their username & password. A laudable goal!\nHowever, using it can be a real pain when building a desktop application. It’s easiest to describe the problem with an example.\nSay you want to build a desktop application that integrates with Twitter. To do so, you have to signup for an API account at Twitter (true for any OAuth service provider), and obtain a secret key which you must ensure never falls into the hands of anyone but you and your application. The reason this key must stay secret is that it is used to create a hash (OAuth refers to it as signing) of every API message sent from your application to the OAuth service provider; lose the key, and anyone can impersonate your application.\nSo the secret key must stay secret. And what do you, the hapless developer, do? You put it on a server, because it’s the only place you can ensure that it stays safe. So, now, for your desktop application to do anything with the API, it has to send messages up to your server to have the API message signed.\nNow here’s the real sticking point. You have to know the identity of the user before signing the request coming to your server. And how do you know that? The user has to somehow log in to this server you were using previously just to perform signing.\nGreat. Now the user has to create a username & password to your site, just so you can use OAuth with Twitter.\nSo, in the end, you users still have to get involved with a username & password. Sure, your Twitter username & password stays locked in Twitter… which is good, no question. But the user experience is still cumbersome, and the amount of work the developer to do is quite high, especially in the case that you don’t already have a web site and login process.\nSo, in summary, to make a desktop application secure with OAuth, you are forced to make a website with a login if you don’t already have one. Ouch.\nI’m admittedly new to OAuth but as far as I can tell, this is the state of affairs with OAuth and desktop applications.", "label": 1}
{"text": "When you think about it, it's ridiculous: almost all of those billions of e-mails that find their way around the globe every day are sent in the clear with no encryption of any kind applied to the message. There are two ways to encrypt e-mail: with S/MIME, built into Apple's Mail application—but this requires getting (read: buying) a certificate—and GPG.\nGPG is a command line utility and GPGMail is a plugin that lets Mail.app use GPG to create and check digital signatures and to encrypt and decrypt messages. Unfortunately, as the GPGMail team has put it, \"GPGMail is a complete hack, relying on Mail's private internal API. Use it at your own risks!\" One of these risks is that Apple brings out OS X 10.4 or 10.5 and it takes many months or even more than a year for an update to come out that supports the new OS. (But complaining is easy; GPGMail is open source, so don't complain too much. Help with coding instead.) Anyway, fairly recently, GPGMail 1.2.0 was released. Leopard users can finally read and write encrypted mail again. Yippee!\nFor those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about but are still reading:\nThese days, simply encrypting something is pretty easy. There are several strong algorithms around and computers are plenty fast to run them. The problem is: how do you make sure the intended recipient and nobody else is able to decode the message? This is where public key cryptography comes in. There are several algorithms that have two different keys: a public one for encryption or checking signatures, and a private one for decryption and creating signatures. Simply generate a pair of keys, keep the private one and publish the public one, and you're in business.\nWell, not entirely. The problem that remains is how to be sure that a public key belongs to a certain person. For HTTPS/SSL, this issue is handled by \"trusted third parties\" (I'm sorry, I can't say those words with a straight face) such as Verisign or DigiCert, who provide a certain level of assurance that a public key (in the form of a certificate) belongs to the party the certificate says it belongs to. However, that's not free—not as in beer (certificates cost money) and also not as in speech, because only organizations that can bribe Apple, Microsoft, the Mozilla Foundation, et cetera get to be \"trusted\" third parties.\nThis is where GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) comes in. GPG is an open source tool that encrypts, decrypts, signs, and checks signatures. It also manages a \"key chain\" of public keys and a web of trust. The idea is that, rather than having a list of trusted third parties and trusting them when they say that someone is who they say they are, everyone manages their own trust relationships and exports these for use by others. So, if I trust Jacqui and Jacqui trusts Clint, just attaching her signature to his public key wouldn't ensure me that this public key is indeed Clint's. But if David and Eric also sign Clint's key, that's good enough for me and I'll trust Clint's key, too. (Note that \"trust\" just means \"knows that this is indeed that person's key.\" It's perfectly reasonable to sign a stranger's key after checking his or her ID.)\nGPG is a command line tool, but after installing it and generating a public/private key pair and uploading it to a key server, it's generally not necessary to use the command line—GPGMail adds a bunch of menu items to Mail that make it possible to use GPG from within Mail.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Editor's note: Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author of \"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.\" Read more of his writing at http://www.schneier.com/\n(CNN) -- Google made headlines when it went public with the fact that Chinese hackers had penetrated some of its services, such as Gmail, in a politically motivated attempt at intelligence gathering. The news here isn't that Chinese hackers engage in these activities or that their attempts are technically sophisticated -- we knew that already -- it's that the U.S. government inadvertently aided the hackers.\nIn order to comply with government search warrants on user data, Google created a backdoor access system into Gmail accounts. This feature is what the Chinese hackers exploited to gain access.\nGoogle's system isn't unique. Democratic governments around the world -- in Sweden, Canada and the UK, for example -- are rushing to pass laws giving their police new powers of Internet surveillance, in many cases requiring communications system providers to redesign products and services they sell.\nMany are also passing data retention laws, forcing companies to retain information on their customers. In the U.S., the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act required phone companies to facilitate FBI eavesdropping, and since 2001, the National Security Agency has built substantial eavesdropping systems with the help of those phone companies.\nSystems like these invite misuse: criminal appropriation, government abuse and stretching by everyone possible to apply to situations that are applicable only by the most tortuous logic. The FBI illegally wiretapped the phones of Americans, often falsely invoking terrorism emergencies, 3,500 times between 2002 and 2006 without a warrant. Internet surveillance and control will be no different.\nOfficial misuses are bad enough, but it's the unofficial uses that worry me more. Any surveillance and control system must itself be secured. An infrastructure conducive to surveillance and control invites surveillance and control, both by the people you expect and by the people you don't.\nChina's hackers subverted the access system Google put in place to comply with U.S. intercept orders. Why does anyone think criminals won't be able to use the same system to steal bank account and credit card information, use it to launch other attacks or turn it into a massive spam-sending network? Why does anyone think that only authorized law enforcement can mine collected Internet data or eavesdrop on phone and IM conversations?\nThese risks are not merely theoretical. After September 11, the NSA built a surveillance infrastructure to eavesdrop on telephone calls and e-mails within the U.S. Although procedural rules stated that only non-Americans and international phone calls were to be listened to, actual practice didn't match those rules. NSA analysts collected more data than they were authorized to and used the system to spy on wives, girlfriends and notables such as President Clinton.\nBut that's not the most serious misuse of a telecommunications surveillance infrastructure. In Greece, between June 2004 and March 2005, someone wiretapped more than 100 cell phones belonging to members of the Greek government: the prime minister and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs and justice.\nEricsson built this wiretapping capability into Vodafone's products and enabled it only for governments that requested it. Greece wasn't one of those governments, but someone still unknown -- A rival political party? Organized crime? Foreign intelligence? -- figured out how to surreptitiously turn the feature on.\nAnd surveillance infrastructure can be exported, which also aids totalitarianism around the world. Western companies like Siemens and Nokia built Iran's surveillance. U.S. companies helped build China's electronic police state. Just last year, Twitter's anonymity saved the lives of Iranian dissidents, anonymity that many governments want to eliminate.\nIn the aftermath of Google's announcement, some members of Congress are reviving a bill banning U.S. tech companies from working with governments that digitally spy on their citizens. Presumably, those legislators don't understand that their own government is on the list.\nThis problem isn't going away. Every year brings more Internet censorship and control, not just in countries like China and Iran but in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and other free countries, egged on by both law enforcement trying to catch terrorists, child pornographers and other criminals and by media companies trying to stop file sharers.\nThe problem is that such control makes us all less safe. Whether the eavesdroppers are the good guys or the bad guys, these systems put us all at greater risk. Communications systems that have no inherent eavesdropping capabilities are more secure than systems with those capabilities built in. And it's bad civic hygiene to build technologies that could someday be used to facilitate a police state.\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The next thing to take a look at is the security in your system against attacks from local users. Did we just say local users? Yes!\nGetting access to a local user account is one of the first things that system intruders attempt while on their way to exploiting the root account. With lax local security, they can then \"upgrade\" their normal user access to root access using a variety of bugs and poorly setup local services. If you make sure your local security is tight, then the intruder will have another hurdle to jump.\nLocal users can also cause a lot of havoc with your system even (especially) if they really are who they say they are. Providing accounts to people you don't know or for whom you have no contact information is a very bad idea.\nYou should make sure you provide user accounts with only the minimal requirements for the task they need to do. If you provide your son (age 10) with an account, you might want him to only have access to a word processor or drawing program, but be unable to delete data that is not his.\nSeveral good rules of thumb when allowing other people legitimate access to your Linux machine:\nGive them the minimal amount of privileges they need.\nBe aware when/where they login from, or should be logging in from.\nMake sure you remove inactive accounts, which you can determine by using the 'last' command and/or checking log files for any activity by the user.\nThe use of the same userid on all computers and networks is advisable to ease account maintenance, and permits easier analysis of log data.\nThe creation of group user-id's should be absolutely prohibited. User accounts also provide accountability, and this is not possible with group accounts.\nMany local user accounts that are used in security compromises have not been used in months or years. Since no one is using them they, provide the ideal attack vehicle.\nThe most sought-after account on your machine is the root (superuser) account. This account has authority over the entire machine, which may also include authority over other machines on the network. Remember that you should only use the root account for very short, specific tasks, and should mostly run as a normal user. Even small mistakes made while logged in as the root user can cause problems. The less time you are on with root privileges, the safer you will be.\nSeveral tricks to avoid messing up your own box as root:\nWhen doing some complex command, try running it first in a non-destructive way...especially commands that use globing: e.g., if you want to do rm foo*.bak, first do ls foo*.bak and make sure you are going to delete the files you think you are. Using echo in place of destructive commands also sometimes works.\nProvide your users with a default alias to the rm command to ask for confirmation for deletion of files.\nOnly become root to do single specific tasks. If you find yourself trying to figure out how to do something, go back to a normal user shell until you are sure what needs to be done by root.\nThe command path for the root user is very important. The command path (that is, the PATH environment variable) specifies the directories in which the shell searches for programs. Try to limit the command path for the root user as much as possible, and never include . (which means \"the current directory\") in your PATH. Additionally, never have writable directories in your search path, as this can allow attackers to modify or place new binaries in your search path, allowing them to run as root the next time you run that command.\nNever use the rlogin/rsh/rexec suite of tools (called the r-utilities) as root. They are subject to many sorts of attacks, and are downright dangerous when run as root. Never create a .rhosts file for root.\nThe /etc/securetty file contains a list of terminals that root can login from. By default (on Red Hat Linux) this is set to only the local virtual consoles(vtys). Be very wary of adding anything else to this file. You should be able to login remotely as your regular user account and then su if you need to (hopefully over Section 6.4 or other encrypted channel), so there is no need to be able to login directly as root.\nAlways be slow and deliberate running as root. Your actions could affect a lot of things. Think before you type!\nIf you absolutely positively need to allow someone (hopefully very trusted) to have root access to your machine, there are a few tools that can help. sudo allows users to use their password to access a limited set of commands as root. This would allow you to, for instance, let a user be able to eject and mount removable media on your Linux box, but have no other root privileges. sudo also keeps a log of all successful and unsuccessful sudo attempts, allowing you to track down who used what command to do what. For this reason sudo works well even in places where a number of people have root access, because it helps you keep track of changes made.\nAlthough sudo can be used to give specific users specific privileges for specific tasks, it does have several shortcomings. It should be used only for a limited set of tasks, like restarting a server, or adding new users. Any program that offers a shell escape will give root access to a user invoking it via sudo. This includes most editors, for example. Also, a program as innocuous as /bin/cat can be used to overwrite files, which could allow root to be exploited. Consider sudo as a means for accountability, and don't expect it to replace the root user and still be secure.", "label": 1}
{"text": "For the past few months I've been beta-testing Microsoft Internet Explorer 7. It comes with a number of new features but, because I'm a language watcher, the feature that most interested me was the Phishing Filter. Huh? Could Microsoft, as corporate and mainstream as a tech company can get, be using the jargon term phishing in its flagship Web browser? At first I figured that it must be some sort of internal code name, but no, it's the actual mass-market name of the feature.\nThis small ripple in the linguistic pool is a reflection not of a newfound coolness on Microsoft's part but of the phishing phenomenon itself, particularly how pervasive it has become and how most folks grasp the theory and seriousness of this vulnerability.\n\"Phishing\" refers to creating a replica of an existing Web page to fool users into submitting personal, financial, or password data to what they think is their bank or a reputable online retailer. The term comes from the fact that Internet scammers use (increasingly sophisticated) lures to \"fish\" for users' sensitive data. Hackers have an endearing tendency to change the letter \"f\" to \"ph,\" so \"fishing\" becomes \"phishing.\" (The f-to-ph transformation is not new among hackers; it first appeared in the late 1960s among the hackers of the telephone system, who called themselves phone phreaks. There are still plenty of these phreaks around today, but often their targets are more modern. A good example is VoIPhreaking, which involves hacking voice-over-Internet-Protocol telephony systems.)\nThe most common ploy used by phishers is to copy the page code from a major Web site--such as AOL or eBay--and use that code to set up a replica page that appears to be legitimate. (This is why phishing is also called brand spoofing.) Fake e-mail is distributed with a link to this page, which solicits the user's credit card data or password. (If it's the latter, then the page is called a password trap.) When the user submits the form, the data go to the scammer, and the user ends up on an actual page from the company's site, so he or she doesn't suspect a thing.\nThe easiest way to detect a phishy page is to look at the page address. A legitimate page will have the correct domain--such as aol.com or ebay.com--while a spoofed page will have only something similar--such as aol.whatever.com or blah.com/ebay. However, some phishers employ tricks such as domain spoofing, replacing the lowercase letter \"L\" with the number \"1\" or the uppercase letter \"O\" with the number \"0.\" This is also called homograph spoofing or a look-alike attack. A similar ploy is IDN spoofing, which uses domain name ambiguities in the user's chosen browser language. (\"IDN\" is short for \"international domain names,\" which refers to domain names written in languages other than English.)\nAnother good way to detect phishing e-mail is to examine the address of the link that you're supposed to click on. Again, this address will point to an obviously nonlegitimate site. Or will it? Recent phishing attempts have used a technique called DNS cache poisoning, a Domain Name System exploit where a \"poisoned\" DNS server is configured to redirect surfers from a legitimate site to the scammer's site. Because the switch occurs somewhere in the network between the user's computer and the Internet at large, it can be very hard to spot.\nAs people become more aware of phishing, they're less likely to fall for obvious ploys such as requests for passwords and credit card data. So the world's dot con artists are revising their schemes to compensate. The latest tool in their nefarious arsenal is spear phishing, which refers to phishing that is targeted at a specific person. This usually consists of sending an e-mail message that has a subject line, body text, and return address that make it appear as though it were sent by someone the recipient knows. For example, you might get a message that appears to come from the head of your IT department, requesting that you visit a particular site to update your password.\nAnother reason people are less likely to fall for a phishing scam is that big corporations are doing a better job of warning their customers and teaching them how to spot fraudulent requests. Scammers are hip to this, so they're trying a new tactic: targeting smaller companies that might not do as good a job warning their customers. These smaller-scale attacks are called puddle phishing. Phishers are also breaking out of the \"fake e-mail and Web site\" paradigm and turning to fraudulent phone calls that attempt to con people out of sensitive data such as their credit card's three- or four-digit security number. This is called phone phishing.\nSo Microsoft is right to include antiphishing technology in Internet Explorer 7, because clearly we need all the help we can get. Maybe the folks there will really get into the spirit of things and hack the company's name, too.

{"text": "You must have heard about it before: formally verified microkernels that offer 100% security... Why don't we use such a microkernel in Qubes then? (The difference between a micro-kernel and a type I hypervisor is blurry. Especially in case of a type I hypervisor used for running para-virtualized VMs, such as Xen used in Qubes. So I would call Xen a micro-kernel in this case, although it can also run fully-virtualized VMs, in which case it should be called a hypervisor I think.)\nIn order to formally prove some property of any piece of code, you need to first assume certain things. One such thing is the correctness of a compiler, so that you can be sure that all the properties you proved for the source code, still hold true for the binary generated from this source code. But let's say it's a feasible assumption -- we do have mature compilers indeed.\nAnother important assumption you need, and this is especially important in proving kernels/microkernels/hypervisors, is the model of the hardware your kernel interacts with. Not necessarily all the hardware, but at least the CPU (e.g. MMU, mode transitions, etc) and the Chipset.\nWhile the CPUs are rather well understood today, and their architecture (we're talking IA32 here) doesn't change so dramatically from season to season. The chipsets, however, are a whole different story. If you take a spec for any modern chipset, let's say only the MCH part, the one closer to the processor (on Core i5/i7 even integrated on the same die), there are virtually hundreds of configuration registers there. Those registers are used for all sorts of different purposes -- they configure DRAM parameters, PCIe bridges, various system memory map characteristics (e.g. the memory reclaiming feature), access to the infamous SMM memory, and finally VT-d and TXT configuration.\nSo, how are all those details modeled in microkernels formal verification process? Well, as far as I'm aware, they are not! They are simply ignored. The nice way of saying this in academic papers is to say that \"we trust the hardware\". This, however, might be incorrectly understood by readers to mean \"we don't consider physical attacks\". But this is not equal! And I will give a practical example in a moment.\nI can bet that even the chipset manufactures (think e.g. Intel) do not have formal models for their chipsets (again, I will give a good example to support this thesis below).\nBut why are the chipsets so important? Perhaps they are configured \"safe by default\" on power on, so even if we don't model all the configuration registers, and their effects on the system, and if we won't be playing with them, maybe it's safe to assume all will be fine then?\nWell, it might be that way, if we could have secure microkernels without IOMMU/VT-d and without some trusted boot mechanism.\nBut we need IOMMU. Without IOMMU there is no security benefit of having a microkernel vs. having a good-old monolithic kernel. Let me repeat this statement again: there is no point in building a microkernel-based system, if we don't correctly use IOMMU to sandbox all the drivers.\nNow, setting up IOMMU/VT-d permissions require programming the chipset's registers, and is by no means a trivial task (see the the Intel VT-d spec to get an impression, if you don't believe me). Correctly setting up IOMMU is one of the most security-critical tasks to be done by a hypervisor/microkernel, and so it would be logical to expect that they also formally prove that this part is done flawlessly...\nThe next thing is the trusted boot. I will argue that without proper trusted boot implementation, the system cannot be made secure. And I'm not talking about physical attacks, like Evil Maid. I'm talking about true, remote, software attacks. If you haven't read it already, please go back and read my very recent post on \"Remotely Attacking Network Cards\". Building on Loic's and Yves-Alexis' recent research, I describe there a scenario how we could take their attack further to compromise even such a securely designed system as Qubes. And this could be possible, because of a flaw in TXT implementation. And, indeed, we demonstrated an attack on Intel Trusted Execution Technology that exploits one such flaw before.\nLet's quickly sketch the whole attack in points:\n- The attacker attacks a flaw in the network card processing code (Loic and Yves-Alexis)\n- The attacker replaces the NIC's firmware in EEPROM to survive the reboot (Loic and Yves-Alexis)\n- The new firmware attacks the system trusted boot via a flaw in Intel TXT (ITL)\n- If the system uses SRTM instead, it's even easier -- see the previous post (ITL)\n- If you have new SINIT module that patched our attack, there is still an avenue to attack TXT via SMM (ITL)\nAnd this is the practical example I mentioned above. I'm sure readers understand that this is just one example, of what could go wrong on the hardware level (and be reachable to a software-only attacker). Don't ignore hardware security! Even for software attacks!\nA good question to ask is: would a system with a formally verified microkernel also be vulnerable to such an attack? And the answer is yes! Yes, unless we could model and prove correctness of the whole chipset and the CPU. But nobody can do that today, because it is impossible to build such a model. If it was, I'm pretty sure Intel would already have such a model and they would not release an SINIT module with this stupid implementation bug we found and exploited in our attack.\nSo, we see an example of a practical attack that could be used to fully compromise a well designed system, even if it had a formally verified microkernel/hypervisor. Compromise it remotely, over the network!\nSo, are all those whole microkernel/hypervisor formal verification attempts just a waste of time? Are they only good for academics so that they could write more papers for conferences? Or for some companies to use them in marketing?\nPerhaps the formal verification of system software will never be able to catch up with the pace of hardware development... By the time people will learn how to build models (and how to solve them) for hardware used today, the hardware manufactures, in the meantime, will present a few new generations of the hardware. For which the academics will need another 5 years to catch up, and so on.\nPerhaps the industry will take a different approach. Perhaps in the coming years we will get hardware that would allow us to create untrusted hypervisors/kernels that would not be able to read/write usermode pages (Hey Howard;)? This is currently not possible with the hardware we have, but, hey, why would a hypervisor need access to the Firefox pages?\nAnd how this all will affect Qubes? Well, the Qubes project is not about building a hypervisor or a microkernel. Qubes is about how to take a secure hypervisor/microkernel, and how to build the rest of the system in a secure, and easy to use, way, using the isolation properties that this hypervisor/microkernel is expected to provide. So, whatever kernels we will have in the future (better formally verified, e.g. including the hardware in the model), or based on some exciting new hardware features, still Qubes architecture would make perfect sense, I think.", "label": 1}
