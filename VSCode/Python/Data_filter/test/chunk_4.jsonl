{"text": "Every day we hear news reports in the mainstream media about social network hacking,malware,malicious account takeovers and protecting data. It doesn’t matter if you are the average Joe Blow or a huge corporation like Burger King,everyone is being targeted these days.\nCyber criminals are searching for everything from your banking and financial info to your email,Facebook and other social networking passwords. Luckily there are technologies and a few simple practices that can help you stay safer online,as well as offline.\nHere are 5 Mandatory Steps that you should follow for protecting data from hacking and eavesdroppers….\n1. IMPORTANT:Use Strong Encryption To Protect Your Files\nEncryption is the process of encoding a message,or any other data,in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it,but authorized parties can. Today there are many options that provide both software and hardware encryption solutions for protecting your data.\nTrueCrypt is a free open source software that provides automatic,real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent data encryption. With TrueCrypt you can encrypt a single partition or an entire storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.\nPhoto Credit:kchbrown (Creative Commons)", "label": 1}
{"text": "Your time spent playing Call of Duty and watching Robot Wars might prepare you for combat better than basic training does. Unmanned vehicles, on land, in the air and in the ocean, are the future of warfare. A Visiongain defense report states that spending on unmanned ground combat vehicles (UGCVs) alone will top $700 million in 2011.\nUnmanned military vehicles come in two types: Autonomous and teleoperated. The former pilot themselves, repair themselves, gather information about their surroundings and try to keep people and property safe while achieving military objectives. Teleoperated systems, meanwhile, work in the manner of remote-controlled cars. Someone sitting in a control center thousands of miles away can direct their actions.\nThe American military relies increasingly upon UGVs. Such vehicles can handle mundane tasks like border surveillance, freeing up human soldiers for more sensitive and vital missions. They can also handle dangerous tasks, like locating and defusing improvised explosive devices. This protects soldiers in combat, allowing them to live and fight another day.\nLast month, defense contractor Oshkosh Defense showed the industry its newest UGV, TerraMax. The advanced UGV successfully piloted itself for over six miles without input from a GPS. This news came the same day that the Army ended research and development on the Multifunction Utility / Logistics and Equipment Vehicle, also known as “MULE.” But that move came more out of a sense that it was outdated and redundant with other defense department robotics program. And the broader trend worldwide is toward more robots and fewer men on the battlefield.\nThe increased use of unmanned vehicles comes with both promise and pitfalls. Perfected UGVs deliver on the promise of the neutron bomb — i.e. blowing up things while leaving people intact, and without that whole “rendered inhabitable for generations” problem. Humanity might enter a future where war still exists, but with highly diminished casualty levels, both in terms of military and civilian deaths.\nStill, there are a number of problems with unmanned vehicles. While taking the human equation out of war removes the possibility of human error, it also takes the human element out of war. Further, UGVs also raise the specter of nations going to war as easily as they would play a game of Command and Conquer.\nOh, and the technology isn’t anywhere near perfect yet. The military uses drones extensively in Pakistan, with mixed results. Numbers vary, but the Brookings Institute estimates that around ten civilians are killed for every enemy combatant in Pakistan, while the Bureau of Investigative Journalism states that around 385 civilians have died due to drone attacks, with over 160 children included in that number. The Central Intelligence Agency, unsurprisingly offers a more conservative number; according to the CIA, no civilians have died due to drone attacks since May 2010.\nSuch “collateral damage” is problematic for pragmatic as well as humanitarian reasons. Not only does it royally piss off the civilian population in countries nominally allied with the United States, it also raises issues of international law. Lawmakers in Pakistan and human rights lawyers internationally have called for prosecutions related to civilian deaths. This means that soldiers controlling these robots might be arrested and tried by American allies, as well as enemies.\nFinally, as the connection between men and the battlefield becomes severed, so does the connection between the men fighting a war together. The bonds forged by men in battle are not the same as the bonds forged by men playing video games. Future generations of soldiers piloting and programming unmanned military vehicles will have an experience most akin to a few hours spent on Xbox than Band of Brothers. The real cost of that runs even deeper. When war feels just like a video game, will anyone give a crap about human life?", "label": 1}
{"text": "How microservers could change the data center\nThere’s a growing wind in the sails of microservers, a new type of datacenter computer that is extremely energy efficient and tailor made for the cloud- and Internet-style workloads that are increasingly common at agencies and other big enterprises.\nDell joins some smaller players and recently introduced its initial line of microservers, Intel has begun shipping the first of several processors designed specifically for use in microservers, and Facebook officials say they have big plans for the diminutive computers.\nIn a recent story we covered the reasons why microservers are expected to make a huge splash even though they buck one of the hottest trends in enterprise computing, the use of virtualization software to consolidate data processing chores on to fewer, more powerful servers. If you are interested in learning more about microservers, read on for some links to key news items, case studies, analysis and technical discussions.\nMicroservers put a low-power microprocessor, like those designed for smartphones and tablets, on a single circuit board, then pack dozens or hundreds of those cards into one server cabinet that provides centralized power supply, cooling fans and network connections.\nThere are many opportunities for using microservers to drastically reduce datacenter operating costs, including:\n* Web applications with high volumes of small discrete transactions, like user logins, searches, checking e-mail and simple Web page views.\n* Running hosting services that provide a dedicated physical machine for each application or user.\n* Creating grids or clusters in which multiple server nodes work in parallel on a specific task.\n* Environments that need to reduce the energy consumption and physical footprint of their data center servers.\nSome folks think microservers will eventually dominate most cloud datacenters. John Treadway, global director, cloud computing solutions at Unisys, makes a persuasive case for microservers on his personal blog CloudBzz. He predicts that microservers will replace bigger servers running virtualization in most commercial cloud datacenters by 2018, with internal enterprise datacenters on the same path though a few years later.\nTo see what a large-scale cloud datacenter packed to the gills with microservers looks like, click on the YouTube video available on this webpage from Data Center Knowledge. It’s taken inside French hosting company Online.net’s facility and features early microservers built by Dell. The section showing the microservers begins about 1:20 into the video.\nFacebook is one of the highest profile players in the U.S. to endorse the microserver approach for large scale data centers. In this article from PCWorld, Gio Coglitore, director of Facebook labs, lays out the rationale for the social networking giant’s plans to move to microservers, with reasons that include energy efficiency, avoiding virtualization vendor lock in and increasing system resiliency.\nOne of the better write ups that clearly explains the value proposition for microservers is available from one of the industry’s earliest players, SeaMicro. It’s a case study about Mozilla, the group that organizes the development of the Firefox Web browser, and their use of microservers. One of the most interesting parts of the article describes how Mozilla officials calculated, among other cost and efficiency metrics, the energy required to perform a certain processing task, in this case an Internet HTTP request. They concluded that microservers used one-fifth the power per HTTP request than a traditional server.\nCorrelating power consumption with the work output of an IT system is a more advanced and meaningful way to calculate datacenter energy efficiency than the metrics CIOs now use most often. Last year I wrote a story about efforts to increase the use of these more sophisticated metrics. [\nIf you really want to get into the weeds about the relative performance of different processor approaches and their suitability for varying types of workloads, there are a couple of good papers that size up those debates.\nOne paper from a group of researchers out of Carnegie Mellon University evaluates the use of clusters of low power chips like in microservers deployed in what is called a Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes. The FAWN approach can be a much more energy efficient option for many types of workloads, but not all. The researchers note that the power costs of large datacenters accounts for up to half of the three-year total cost of owning a computer.\nOn the other hand, Google released a paper from one of its researchers that details the drawbacks in certain situations of arrays of wimpy chips. What happens is that wimpy-core systems can require software applications to be specially written to run on them, resulting in extra development costs that can take a big bite out of the energy savings.\nPosted by John Zyskowski on May 27, 2011 at 12:07 PM", "label": 1}
{"text": "Most Malware Found on Trusted Web Pages, Report Says\nFive seconds into reading this story, a Web page somewhere will become infected with malware or some other malicious code. That's one of the conclusions of U.K.-based IT security firm Sophos in an IT security report\nreleased on Wednesday.\n\"We found that there is an average of 16,173 infected Web pages on a daily basis,\" said Sophos' Senior Technology Consultant Graham Cluley in a phone interview from his office in London. \"We arrived at this conclusion from our labs around the world. We look at millions of e-mails and Web page transmissions on a daily basis and it averages out to one infected page every five seconds.\"\nThe threat report covers the first six months of this year and according to Cluley and the report itself, the page infections are occurring at a rate three times faster than the comparable period in 2007.\nThe report identified the Windows OS as the largest target for malware. It also found that 90 percent of infected Web pages derived from trusted sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as other oft-visited destinations.\nThe report pegged the do-it-yourself blogging portal Blogspot.com as the top host for malware on the World Wide Web, with an estimated two percent of the malicious software being incubated and launched on that site alone. The study also mentioned the astronomical rise of spam on mobile devices in places such as China, where such junk mail messages grew to almost 354 billion in 2007.\nThe one major security theme in the report was the recent rise in SQL injection attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in application code linked to a back-end database. These attacks can provide an entrance for hackers, allowing them to elevate their network privileges and change data fields.\n\"What we've seen with these attacks is that even if you clean up the database and get rid of the virus there, it could either be just a decoy for another injection attack or another virus will come along soon,\" Cluley said.\nAt risk are traditional brick-and-mortar companies that have decided to foster an increased presence on the Web. Their e-commerce platforms could be vulnerable to manipulation by hackers, the report stresses. In addition to applying security patches, some enterprises should have a \"security lock box\" or Web appliance as a buffer between the end user and the enterprises' infrastructure.\nThe lessons particularly apply to small and mid-size companies.\n\"Hackers have by and large stopped using e-mail as an entry point and instead decided to frame their attacks in and around the Web browser,\" Cluley further warned. \"Big companies may have the infrastructure and the money to act, but the real necessity here is for small and medium sized businesses to reassess Internet security. This is clearly an opportunity for channel partners as well as enterprises themselves to collaborate and get involved, whether it's a consultant for the business or an internal mandate.\"\nJabulani Leffall is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in the Financial Times of London, Investor's Business Daily, The Economist and CFO Magazine, among others.", "label": 1}

{"text": "STMicroelectronics and Bluechiip Limited have announced that they will partner to manufacture unique micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based tracking tags initially aimed at healthcare markets. Because the Bluechiip tracking tag is a mechanical device rather than an electronic one, it can survive in temperature extremes and is immune gamma irradiation. This robustness provides significant advantages over more traditional identification and tracking solutions such as labels, barcodes, and RFID technologies, and provides the high levels of data surety in the rapidly growing and labor-intensive healthcare markets, especially in biobanking.\nThe tags offered by ST and Bluechiip will be molded into test tubes and vials for the expanding biobank market to identify, track, retrieve, monitor and store valuable and irreplaceable human biospecimens, including tissue, embryos and cord blood in liquid nitrogen. Although the Bluechiip tracking technology will be applied first in the healthcare industry, it also has applications in pathology, clinical trials, biorepositories and forensics. Other key markets for the technology could include security, defense, industrial, manufacturing, waste, aerospace and aviation.\nThis new technology enables data to be read at temperatures as low as those reached in liquid nitrogen, approximately -196 degrees C, and as high as 200 degrees C. Data can be transmitted through frost. Bluechiip's tracking solution has been field-proven to survive autoclaving, gamma irradiation sterilization, humidification, centrifuging, cryogenic storage and frosting.\nThe new technology is based on MEMS-based resonators within a tiny and purely mechanical chip, containing no electronics whatsoever. The tracking tag, which comprises this mechanical chip and an antenna, can either be embedded or manufactured into a storage product, such as a vial or a bag. Easy identification, along with any associated information from the tag can be detected by a reader, which can also log the temperature history of the tagged items.\nIn March 2009, TIME Magazine highlighted biobanking as one of \"10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now\". The growth of biobanks worldwide has been exponential; recent studies estimate that hundreds of millions of tissue samples are stored in U.S. biobanks and greater than one billion are stored worldwide. In a recent report by Visiongain titled \"Biobanking for Medical R&D: Technology and Market 2010-2025\", the market for biobanking (sales of biobank resources or services) in 2009 was estimated to be worth $8B and is expected to reach $45B by 2025.\nFor more information about STMicroelectronics, visit www.st.com\n.

Furthermore, it’s also important that people monitor their children’s activity while they are online also. Taking these precautionary steps will help to ensure that people are safeguarded from unauthorized activity or spammers while they are online.\nFirst of all when one is using the Internet, they should never browse to malicious sites as these can contain malware and viruses. Additionally, if one is sent fishy looking emails, they should also be wary as these contain malware and viruses. If an individual receives spam emails, they should go ahead and just delete them immediately. Opening these types of emails can cause unwanted activity on the computer such as malware or viruses.\nAs for safeguarding the computer, there is also malware software, anti-virus software as well as pop-up blocker software. These programs will assist one on the Internet to help block spam ads or other pops ups along with malicious websites. People should also be very careful about the types of online shopping they do, where they shop and what financial information is given.\nIf the individual sees that the website is not very reputable and seems like it could be a fake, it most likely is. Fake websites are designed by hackers to steal people’s financial information. On another note, people should also refrain from ever using public computers to engage in financial activity as people may steal this information.\nLastly, there could be sites that pose as the real website one would like to log into. When someone logs into the fake page, their information can be stolen to abuse their account in some way. As for children using the Internet, they should be monitored when they are online to ensure that they are not visiting bad sites or sites that could get them into trouble.

{"text": "Network in full view\nIPsonar creates a working map to detect IP-connected devices within the enterprise.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE seen the poster that at first glance looks like either a view through a microscope or a time-release photo of a festive fireworks display. On closer inspection, of course, you'd see this is a map of the Internet, which displays all of the routers in existence organized by their IP numbers.\nThe first map was made in 1998 at Bell Labs, shortly before Lumeta, which owns the mapping technology, spun off from Bell. Since then, Lumeta has been improving its IPsonar technology and producing a new map of the Internet every year or so since.\nThe company's IPsonar 4.1 brings the power of the Internet Mapping Project to your own little corner of the Internet ' your network. It will detect all the devices in a specified range of IP numbers, and let you see what you have and how they relate to one another, and can identify if you have a leak.\nIPsonar gathers information about network devices in four phases of discovery. During Network Discovery in our testing, the program identified the devices in the network and how they were interconnected. It paid particular attention to forwarding and filtering devices, in addition to the connectivity of network firewalls and router access control lists.\nThe second task was Host Discovery, in which the program conducted a search of all the IP addresses. IPsonar uses multiprotocol discovery to find previously unknown IP addresses, which always seem prevalent on larger networks.\nThe third phase, Leak Discovery, is probably the most useful for any network administrator concerned with data security. In this phase, IPsonar scanned our various hosts to see if they could accept inbound or send outbound packets to the Internet or other sub-networks. Even devices that are on a secure network but can exchange information with another device on a nonsecure network would be suspect.\nYou can set the number of links in the chain you want the program to check. Leaks are discovered using an external leak sensor ' Lumeta maintains several leak sensors that you can use for testing. IPsonar checks for open communication chains by sending a device a fake packet that looks as if it comes from a leak sensor. If a device responds back to the sensor, you know you have a leak. This pinging is like the old World War II method that submarines and sub hunters would use to find their targets, hence the name of the product.\nVersion 4.1 adds a Device Fingerprint Discovery sensor, which identifies services, wireless access points and computer operating system information on the network. It will allow a network administrator to balance application resources, get a grip on improperly secured access points, and know at a glance which machines are running which versions of operating systems.\nWe found IPsonar to be relatively easy to set up. After we connected a monitor and keyboard to the server and set its IP number, it was ready to be administrated through a Web-based graphical user interface.\nPerforming a search is only complicated because of all the options available to increase flexibility. We were pleased to find the option for Tactical Scan, which was quickly implemented and was only concerned with one IP address.\nTo initiate a more detailed scan, you click on a tab that has every conceivable option. You can choose which type of scan ' based upon the four phases mentioned above ' to perform. For each choice, there are options such as which protocols IPsonar will use to make its discoveries. You also can set IP ranges ' called Classless Inter- Domain Routing blocks ' to be targeted or specifically avoided in this scan. You can even schedule a scan to perform only within a certain window of time.\nThe Manage Reports page lets you display an existing report or generate a new one when a scan is performed. The raw data of the scan can be viewed in many ways, so it's fairly easy to find the format that makes the most sense for your situation. To get a view of your network and how the components relate to one another, you can use the Map Viewer software that comes with the Server. After loading all of the necessary .NET and Java enhancements and installing the software onto a client machine, Map Viewer can grab a report generated by IPsonar and show you a relational map of all of the routers on your network. This graphical display can help network administrators visualize how a network is functioning and how sweeping changes might affect it.\nAdditional sensors can be placed on the network to make the scans run faster and generate even more accurate information, while taking some of the load off of the server, which centrally manages everything. Additional servers can also be purchased to perform as dedicated report servers, which helps extremely large networks.\nLumeta sells the IPsonar 4.1 Server for $75,000, which is reasonable for such a powerful product that can find devices you didn't even know you had. Additional servers sell for $25,000, and additional sensors cost $7,500. For large networks, these will likely pay for themselves.\nIPsonar is for any administrator of a medium to large network who needs to get a view of how it is organized and track down stray devices.Lumeta (732) 357-3500, www.lumeta.com", "label": 1}
{"text": "Collections of subverted machines, called\nbotnets are typically\nassociated with Windows; thousands of zombie desktops sending spam and\ncausing other internet mayhem. Unfortunately, it is increasingly clear\nthat Linux boxes (as well as MacOS X and other UNIX boxes) are\nparticipating in botnets, but in a bit of a twist, it is mostly servers\nthat have been subverted. Botnets are an enormous problem that\nVint Cerf recently\nmay involve up to one quarter of all internet connected computers. This\ntranslates to a botnet controller's fondest wish: 150 million zombie machines\nto rent to the highest bidder.\nDesktops are usually infected with a bot by an email-borne virus or a\ntrojan attached to some application that the user installs, much like\nadware and spyware infect machines. The bot software then connects to a\n'command and control' (C&C) infrastructure, that often use Internet Relay\nChat (IRC) servers, to get instructions on what they should do. The 'owner'\nof a botnet (known as a bot herder) can then instruct the bots to do whatever\nthey, or more likely their client, want. Because the traffic\ngenerated from a botnet comes from all over the Internet, it is difficult\nor impossible to recognize it for what it is. This allows botnets to be\nused for spamming, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, click fraud and\nother malicious activities in a largely untraceable way.\nThe desktop infection methods are not typically as useful for Linux boxes\nand so bot herders have turned to web application exploits as a means\nfor collecting subverted machines. Attacking servers has the additional\nadvantage that they are usually machines with much greater resources:\nfaster network connectivity, more storage, faster processors, etc. The attacks\nare largely targeted at everyone's favorite Internet security whipping\nboy, PHP applications. Open source PHP applications are the\nmain target as they are ubiquitous and typically easy to exploit as\nindicates. An additional benefit of targeting a higher level application\nis that it is a cross-platform exploit; the operating system and web server\nsoftware are immaterial if the target is a PHP application.\nThe easiest type of vulnerability to exploit is often\nInclusion (RFI) which allows an attacker to run code on a\nvulnerable server with the permissions of the webserver. Generally,\nthose permissions are sufficient to allow the bot to do anything the herder\nmight wish it to; sending email and other network traffic is not normally a privileged\nactivity. Even a cursory glance at the Bugtraq mailing list will reveal\nnumerous RFI vulnerabilities; they are reported regularly and each can lead\nto bot exploitation if not patched.\nMany different types of malware can be installed on a vulnerable machine,\ndepending on the intent of the herder. As with the exploit itself, the\ninstalled code tends to be written in a scripting language so that it is\ncross-platform. The malware can range from simple test tools\nthat indicate vulnerable servers to sophisticated shells that allow the\nattacker to effectively login to the server and perform any allowed operation.\nThe most serious damage that these botnets have caused is to our\ninbox; bots seem to be the preferred way to deliver spam these days.\nDiligent anti-spam efforts tend to get spamming accounts or systems shut\ndown within hours but there is no easy way to shut down a spam-delivering botnet. A less\nvisible, but potentially more damaging effect is DDOS\non internet sites. By attacking a site and working their way up the\nchain of DNS servers and registrars, a botnet can silence a site the herder\ndoes not like or hold sites hostage until they pay a ransom.\nPast efforts to thwart botnets have often focused on destroying the C&C\nservers by shutting down the affected IRC sites, but botnets are\nmoving toward using HTTP for C&C which allows that traffic to hide amongst\nthe sea of similar traffic; it also has the advantage of getting through\nmost firewalls. Botnets will be a serious problem going forward, and Linux\nsystems are not immune to participation in them. The\nfinancial incentive is large and the means of prevention are weak, at least\nso far.

{"text": "We all have a vested interest in how data and data privacy is enacted by companies, regardless of the environment, cloud, mobile (laptop, cell phones), private Data Center, or anything else that is a combination of the above. Companies have a vested interest in keeping their customers data private and clear of distortion or error. Consumers and people in social networks also have a vested interest in making sure that the data they share is not abused or misused.\nThe clear and present problem is that while there are data privacy standards, there are data privacy laws, and sanctions on how data is to be protected, all of these have in many ways failed because of the human implementation of security and security practices. Even something as simple as Google Voice has a major security flaw that allows a hacker to listen to any Google Voice exchange that was recorded without a password, without a login, without authentication of any kind, just use a simple Google search and the wealth of private personal information is yours to listen to, archive, and use.\nWe have seen far too many instances of hacking activity or general carelessness on the part of people at all levels of an organization, that takes out companies like TJX, or breaches being reported by OSF Data Loss DB. Every day thousands of people have their data and identities lost because of carelessness, improper controls, or security people or regular old employees not doing the jobs they are entrusted with. Every day, every week, and every year millions of people are impacted by poor security practices across the organization. Cloud computing adds to the complexity of the situation, but there is no reason why data in the cloud cannot be as secure as data anywhere else when it is at rest, we have laws to control who has access to data at rest, we still do not implement them well.\nKeeping customer data safe is a primary consideration of companies who use data in any form. What should companies be doing to make sure it is protected? First and foremost they should be carefully evaluating the security posture of their companies including people who take customer data home on laptops or other walk out the door systems like USB Keys, portable Hard Drives, DVD and CD-ROMS, Google Mail, social networks, and any other way that data can be transferred.\nThe problem is with the cut backs in IT, and IT personnel at some of the companies I have visited and talked to lately, there are not enough people to monitor or maintain the networks, backups and other IT security functions (including audit) to do the job that must be done. IT Security and Audit can be a labor intensive job when something is going on, or when a data breach is suspected. Recent problems with Disaster Recovery at Microsoft between Bing and Sidekick shows that controls are slacking at major corporations, recent break-ins to state liquor networks show that break-ins are happening in governmental systems, reports that NASA is too easy to break into shows that the same thing is happening at the Federal Level, TJX was simply the tip of the iceberg, we are now seeing how large a problem this is for companies at all levels and in all sizes.\nI will be attending an Industry Expert Panel Discussion on Data Privacy at Secure World Expo in Bellevue as a panel member to discuss this issue. There are no clean answers, we have cut our staffs to the bone, we no longer have budget to support new staff, company employees are rarely trained on a routine basis on data protection, management is worried about numbers and often approaches the idea of information security as something they must do, but dollars do not flow to the right people, or budget is taken for some other high priority project.\nI invite you to attend this free panel discussion, we will be talking about how to define private confidential data, regulations, social media, the intersection of people and technology, mobile storage and mobile communications. This will be a very interesting panel discussion about where we think we are going, and what obviously needs to be address.\nRelated articles by Zemanta\n- Cloud Computing Does Not Absolve a Company of Good Disaster Planning (cloudave.com)\n- Cloud Security and Privacy (oreilly.com)\n- A Plan to Secure the Federal Cyberspace, Part 3 (computerworld.com)\n- Sidekick foul-up is not a failure of the cloud (macworld.com)\n- The Lego Internet (cloudave.com)\n(Cross-posted @ TechWag)", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cloud computing is simply computers somewhere else, dolling out software or hardware recourses over the Internet or local network. The inherent risks all still exist, but not on site. Despite this, the cloud has become quite popular with businesses and institutions as a way of storing and accessing data and information on demand.\nSome of these institutions, including large US law firms, are slowly and reluctantly implementing the use of these services, but have fears that sensitive information could potentially be compromised (hacked) by exploiting their relatively weak security measures.\nUsing these services, such as IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service), StaaS (storage-as-a-service), and PaaS (platform-as-a-service), can be both beneficial and potentially risky for those involved in the US justice system.\nOn one side of the cloud coin, major law firms can store an incredible amount of legal documentation that can be accessed at any given point for documentation management. This means that records are less likely to be lost, damaged, or misfiled over data stored locally on hard drives or physical paper filing. Cloud services also provide the end-user the ability to manage human resources more efficiently, a centrally-controlled email management system (easier for containing viruses, spam checking, etc.), and the reduction of physical hardware needed in-house, which can also reduce the costs associated with IT services.\nThe other side of that coin is painted in an unattractive light, and is anything but beneficial to large law firms: Security risks that can potentially compromise sensitive material such as confidential client information and court litigation information. Cloud services generally use the same security measures (firewall, IPsec Protocol, anti-virus protection, etc.) and encryption methods of a typical shared multi-user mainframe (server). The problem with implementing cloud defense tactics is that the services are still in their infancy, which means security measures are basic at best.\nThere are some choices that could easily be integrated into the various services, potentially increasing the cloud's overall defensive posture in detering cyber-attacks, such as those implemented by the US military, including ultra-strong secure operating systems. These are based on system kernel technology (such as the Bell-LaPadula model, which enforces access control) that reinforces key security policies in the OS that are absolutely enforced in the system, and therefore extremely difficult to gain access.\nThe operating systems designed using kernel-based tactics (such as Honeywell SCOMP, NSA Blacker, Boeing MLS LAN, and USAF SACDIN) are used to secure critical information along the lines of national security, classified military data, and information regarding international financial institutions.\nOrange Book A-1 (taken from the DoD’s Trusted Computer Evaluation Criteria standard), is the top of the line for classified information. It’s still not completely secure, as anyone willing and able could find ways around those measures. However, adapting cloud services to use the kernel method of anti-intrusion is a very viable option for large law firms to implement. It could effectively ease the fears associated with storing sensitive legal data in a cloud environment.\nDo you think the information you store in the cloud is safe?

{"text": "Everyone knows the story of Napster, the peer-to-peer file-sharing service that was shut down by the major labels a decade ago. The destruction of Napster pushed peer-to-peer file sharing underground, leading to the rise of Grokster, the Pirate Bay, Megaupload, and dozens of other services that facilitate illicit file sharing. It may also have created a larger market for licensed services such as iTunes.\nBut a new Google-funded study argues that the destruction of Napster and the litigation campaign that followed it had deeper and more far-reaching implications than is commonly appreciated. The author, Rutgers-Camden law professor Michael Carrier, conducted interviews with dozens of senior executives who were working at music labels, venture capital firms, and music-related startups during the Napster era.\nMany of them argued that the labels' aggressive litigation campaign against Napster and other early music startups created a venture capital \"wasteland,\" with music-related startups unable to raise money. The result, Carrier concludes, has been a stunted pace of innovation that continues to this day.\nThe Recording Industry Association of American disputed Carrier's findings. \"The fundamental mistake that this study, and other pieces like it, make is to assume that the only type innovation is technological,\" the organization said. The firms the labels sued a decade ago were \"not innocent 'innovators,'\" the group wrote. \"Most unlicensed p2p services were very well aware that what they were doing was probably illegal, and they were deliberately architecting their software to be able to avoid knowledge.\"\nA scorched-earth campaign\nThe emergence of Napster was a shock for the major labels, which had grown fat on two decades of rapid growth in CD sales. Many of them \"saw the Internet as a fad.\" So it was a rude awakening to discover that millions of their former customers suddenly had the ability to share label music with one another at negligible cost.\nThe labels responded harshly, suing Napster and eventually driving the firm into bankruptcy. And Napster wasn't the only target. Around the same time, the labels also sued cloud music pioneer MP3.com. It would sue numerous music startups during the aughts.\nDefending against copyright litigation can be tremendously expensive. Two people told Carrier that defending a lawsuit by a major label cost $150,000 to $200,000 per month. That's enough money that many startups would go bankrupt even if they ultimately prevailed in court.\nAnd the intimidation tactics reportedly went beyond suing startups. The labels also threatened to file personal lawsuits against the officers and major investors of music startups.\n\"They suck companies dry\"\nThe executives Carrier talked to said the labels made life miserable even for startups that tried to follow the rules.\nOne executive tells of a startup with millions of users that was sued by the labels. The firm told the labels \"You guys made your point; we will charge anything you want to charge, and you can take any percentage you want to take.\" But the labels reportedly responded, \"No, we want you to turn it off.\"\nIndeed, some respondents charged that the labels treated lawsuits against music startups as a short-term revenue source. The labels \"sat in meetings with digital startups and tried to take as much money as they could. They knew their business model was not going to work, that this was not recurrent revenue.\" But bleeding music startups dry helped the labels hit their quarterly revenue targets.\nA venture capitalist reported that the labels insisted on signing short-term deals, one or two years at a time, that could be renegotiated if the startup was more profitable than expected. \"As soon as the companies are profitable, they suck companies dry,\" the VC said.\nThis seems short-sighted. Online piracy wasn't going away, and the failure to provide consumers with access to the music they wanted in convenient online formats surely drove some customers over to the dark side. So why did the labels pursue such an aggressive strategy?\nOne factor was the adamant opposition of brick-and-mortar retailers to online distribution. At the time that Napster burst onto the scene, retailers like Walmart and Tower Records were the labels' primary revenue source. Indeed, some interviewees argued that the labels treated these retailers, not individual fans, as their primary customers. Major retailers had substantial leverage over record labels because they decided whose products would be prominently featured in stores. And they insisted that music not be made available online at prices that would undercut the market for CDs.\nThe labels were also reluctant to undercut the market for physical CDs because they had billions of dollars invested in infrastructure for creating and distributing CDs. One label reportedly \"spent a billion dollars on trucks to distribute their CDs.\" That investment would be wasted if the industry shifted toward low-cost digital downloads.\nThe labels' obsession with preserving the market for CDs led to unrealistic expectations for digital services. For example, before iTunes established the 99-cent price point for music singles, one label was \"adamant\" that \"the single should be priced at $3.25.\" That was high enough that a customer who bought \"two or three\" singles would replace the revenue from selling a full album.\nCarrier also charges that the labels were excessively focused on short-term profits. Executives' bonuses were based on quarterly profits. Nobody got a bonus for making a long-term investment that wouldn't pay off for a few years. Hence, they were more inclined to view the startups they were negotiating with as short-term sources of cash rather than long-term business partners.\nThe RIAA responds\nThe RIAA is not impressed with Carrier's study, and the organization shared with Ars a draft of a forthcoming response. It characterizes it as \"wild speculation based on various assumptions, anonymous musings, and no real metrics,\" and as a vehicle to communicate the author's \"biased views of the industry and clear preference for venture capital investment over protecting the arts.\"\nThe industry group argued that lawsuits were essential to allowing labels and artists to claim a share of the revenues from online music consumption. \"Finding for Napster would have instantly granted every online service the right to copy and distribute (or at least facilitate such action) without any permission or license, and there would have been absolutely no incentive for Napster to negotiate for them,\" the RIAA said.\nThe RIAA also disputed the premise that litigation has diminished venture capital investment, though here it focused more on the 2005 Grokster decision than on the Napster case. \"The legal digital music market grew from less than $200 million in 2004 to more than $3 billion in 2011,\" the association said. \"After a unanimous Supreme Court ruling against Grokster, venture capital investment grew for Media and Entertainment to 7.1 percent of total VC dollars from just 4.6 percent before Grokster.\"\nFinally, the industry group argued that some of the stories told in the study are \"bogus.\" For example, Carrier pointed to a PC World article claiming that the major labels had sought $75 trillion in damages against LimeWire, \"a figure higher than the Gross Domestic Product of the world.\" But as Mike Masnick of Techdirt, no friend of the RIAA, pointed out, there doesn't seem to be any credible evidence for the $75 trillion figure. The case was eventually settled for $105 million.\nThe RIAA has a point in at least one respect: given Carrier's methodology, it's worth taking the study with a large grain of salt. It's not a surprise that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who locked horns with the recording industry in court a decade ago would be willing to badmouth the industry today. Virtually all the quotes are anonymous, and it's not clear if their claims were independently fact-checked.\nStill, the study does point to some serious problems with the recording industry's litigation strategy. The fact that litigation costs have forced startups into bankruptcy after winning in court is a cause for concern. And the uncertainty of the law, along with the threat of statutory damages as high as $150,000 per work, makes it more difficult than it should be for businesses to stand up to industry bullying. The industry's litigation campaign really does seem to have hindered innovation, even if the situation is not as dire as depicted by the RIAA's worst critics.\nUpdate: After this story went live, Carrier sent Ars the following statement:\nYes, they're correct about the Limewire claim. That, as well as the Britney Spears quote about piracy were not correct. Many folks flagged that for me, and I have already taken those points out of the next draft.\nMany of the respondents were more than willing to give their names, but I decided it would be better to have all quotes anonymous. To make sure the quotes were accurate, I sent to all 31 the list of quotes I planned to use. 28 said that my quotes were fine as is or offered some minor suggestions to make them more accurate. The final 3 never responded, but the Wisconsin Law Review will be reviewing these to make sure they're all accurate.\nThe interviewees also included many folks from the labels, who said things very similar to what the innovators said.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Using the exec-shield Kernel Patch on Slackware 10.1\nThe Holy Grail of most any hacker trying to get access to a system is the remote buffer overflow attack. Well, actually, it's finding a Windows PC not protected by a firewall, but the remote buffer overflow attack is a (somewhat) close second. This article will discus one way to help protect against this type of attack on a Slackware Linux system with the installation of a special system called exec-shield. This installation will occur in two phases. The first phase is installing the exec-shield kernel patch, the second is replacing some of Slackware's packages with ones that are compiled to work together with exec-shield.\nWhat is a Buffer Overflow Attack?\nBefore we explain how to protect against a buffer overflow attack, it is useful to examine what exactly this attack is and what the ramifications are for an unprotected system.\nWhen writing software, it's often the case that a programmer needs to set aside memory to hold information coming into the program. This temporary memory, called a buffer, is used to hold data while the program figures out what to do with it. For example, it might be used by a web server to hold the URL of the web page a browser is requesting. The browser sends the URL to the web server, the web server stores it temporarily in a buffer, then it processes the URL to find out exactly what the browser is asking.\nProgrammers often use an area called the stack to create these temporary buffers. A program's stack is a fixed size temporary “scratchpad” area used by programs to store variables. The reason it's called the stack is that it's oriented upside-down from how memory is usually accessed. Memory is usually used from first to last, top to bottom. The stack is used from bottom to top – putting data on the stack is putting another plate on a stack of plates – the last plate you put on is the first one you take off (this is sometimes referred to as “LIFO” – last-in, first-out). In addition to holding variables, the stack is also used to store the return address when a program jumps to a subroutine. That is, when a program jumps to (or “calls”) a subroutine, the address of the location in memory to jump back (return) to when the subroutine is done is stored on the stack.\nBecause the stack is of a limited size, programmers don't like wasting space in it. So when a buffer is needed, programmers make that buffer big enough to hold the largest piece of data going in it, but no larger. In the case of our web server, a long URL is generally going to be somewhere on the order of a few hundred bytes. Some URLs store information for CGI forms, so the programmer might make the buffer as large as two or four kilobytes. Many browsers won't process a URL longer than that. The web server's stack when it is executing the subroutine to process a URL might look something like Illustration 1. The stack grows upward, like a stack of plates, so the return address which was placed on the stack first, is actually located “under” the buffer and other variables that the subroutine uses.\nA buffer overflow attack works by trying to fill a buffer with more information than a programmer has reserved for it in the code. If the program is vulnerable to the attack – if it doesn't check the size of the incoming data before it copies it to its buffer, then a specially crafted URL could overwrite the return address with its own address, and even malicious code to “take over” the program. A program that is taken over in such a way can be used by the attacker to do anything that the user that owns the program can do. If the program is run as root, as quite a few processes are, then a successful attack can give complete control over your system to the attacker.\nIn the past, programs that were vulnerable to such an attack were vulnerable because the programmers who wrote them – honest programmers – never used to think in terms of what a dishonest person might do to break their program. If the specification the programmer was following says the maximum size of a piece of data is so many bytes, then that's how many bytes the programmer allocates for it. There can't be more than that, because the specification says there can't be, so there is no reason to waste memory for a larger buffer, or waste CPU time by performing special checks on the size of the incoming data. Even today with the focus on writing programs that are secure, vulnerabilities crop in. Sometimes they are in parts of the code that are inherited from earlier times when people weren't thinking in such terms. Sometimes it's simply a programmer who made a small mistake, or forgot to think in terms of security. It only takes one such instance to make a program vulnerable to this sort of attack. One report suggests that a vulnerable PC connected to the Internet will be compromised in an average of 20 minutes. Another report suggests that it is as little as four minutes. That's not to suggest that all vulnerabilities are buffer overflow vulnerabilities. That is just one type. However, this author's Slackware firewall PC registers several buffer overflow probes each day in its web server log.\nIf You Don't Need It, Don't Use It\nThe best way to secure against a buffer overflow attack is to run software that isn't vulnerable to such attacks. Performing a full security code audit on every piece of software running on a firewall is generally not within the capacity of most users. However, it is within any user's ability to shut down any services that aren't needed. The first rule of thumb regarding services running on any PC connected to the Internet should be “if you don't need it don't use it”. Slackware is pretty good about not enabling Internet services by default. If your Linux PC is connected to the Internet, take a look at your /etc/inetd.conf file. This file controls what Internet services are supported by the inetd super-server. Go over your configuration file and look for services that you aren't using. If you don't know that you need it, turn it off. An attacker can't attack nothing.\nThe exec-shield Kernel Patch\nIngo Molnar, a kernel hacker (the good kind of hacker) working for Red Hat, has written a patch for the Linux kernel that is designed to protect you against most buffer overflow attacks. It has been made in such a way that it can protect you against such attacks even if you are running software that would otherwise be vulnerable to it. If you look at Illustration 2 above, you notice that the malicious code was stored as data on the stack. The exec-shield system works, in part, by making the stack (and other areas of memory where data is stored) unable to execute code. When a program is loaded into memory for execution, the code and the data are loaded into different areas in memory. There is usually no reason why the data areas need to run code, so the exec-shield patch prevents this. It won't prevent a buffer overflow from occurring in a program that is vulnerable to it, but it will block a hacker from being able to exploit a vulnerability by running malicious code stored on the stack or in data buffers.\nInstalling the patch is not difficult. We will go through the process step-by-step:\nSince this is a kernel patch, you will (of course) need to ensure that you have installed the kernel sources first. If you are using the default kernel with Slackware 10.1 then you have kernel version 2.4.29 and you can install the kernel sources from your Slackware CD or from any Slackware mirror site. If you are running the 2.6.10 kernel from the testing directory, then the kernel source package is testing/packages/linux-2.6.10/kernel-source-2.6.10-noarch-1.tgz – again, available from your Slackware CD or any mirror site.\nTo obtain the exec-shield patch, go to http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/. The patch is (as of the time of this writing) available for the 2.4.29, 2.6.10, and 2.6.11 kernels. Download the patch for your kernel.\nTo apply the patch, change to the top directory inside your kernel tree (/usr/src/linux) and as root run the command:\n$ patch -p1 < ~/exec-shield-2.4.29-A2\nOf course, substitute the path to and filename for the patch you are actually using.\nThere aren't any configuration options for the exec-shield patch, so you can go ahead and build your kernel. If this is the first time you're compiling your own kernel, you will need to configure it first – “make menuconfig” is the easiest way. A full tutorial on how to configure and build a kernel is not within the scope of this article, however there are many resources with information on this. The new “Kernel Rebuild Guide” is probably the best.\nOnce the kernel is built, you will need to install it. Slackware configures lilo to expect the kernel in the /boot directory. A fairly easy way to make sure this happens is to edit the top level Makefile in the Linux kernel tree. In the 2.4 series of kernels, line 77 sets the install path, though this is commented out by default. Uncomment this and set it so the line reads:\nThis way, any time a “make install” is run in the Kernel tree, the new kernel will get put in /boot and lilo will be run automatically to install it. Since lilo is the default loader for Slackware, this makes it very convenient to install new kernels.\nOnce the kernel is installed, you are ready to reboot your PC to load it up, or alternatively you can continue on to replace some of your packages with ones that work with exec-shield.\nSpecial exec-shield Packages\nSome of the protections offered by the exec-shield kernel patch don't require you to do anything more than install the patch and recompile your kernel. However, to get the full benefit from exec-shield, you will need to run binaries that have been compiled for it.\nThe reason for this is a ramification of what was explained earlier. The exec-shield kernel patch will prevent a hacker from being able to use a buffer overflow attack to execute malicious code inserted during the attack. It does this by preventing memory that is used for data from being able to execute code. However, it can't stop the buffer overflow from happening in the first place if you have any software that has a vulnerability. If you refer back to Illustration 1, you will see that the return address for any subroutine is located on the stack. An attacker could conceivably use a buffer overflow attack to replace that return address with one that goes somewhere else – for example, the system function in glibc. If you have the man pages installed on your Slackware PC, type “man system” and you will see that this function could be used by an attacker to run any shell command on your PC. Don't fret, the exec-shield patch protects against this too, but in a slightly different way.\nIn order for a malicious attacker to get your system to do what the attacker wants it to do by using a buffer overflow to rewrite a return address, the attacker has to know the exact address in memory on your system of a useful function. Without exec-shield installed, the address of the system() function on my system might be the same as it is on hundreds of other Slackware PCs, simply because what Slackware installs on different systems may be virtually identical. With exec-shield, however, the kernel randomizes where in memory any shared library is loaded. It also randomizes where the stack and any extra data for any particular program is. What it can't randomize is where in memory a particular program is loaded. This is because the load address for a program is determined when it is compiled.\nIn order to randomize the location in memory where a program is loaded, the program has to be compiled in a new way – it has to be compiled as a “position-independent executable”, or PIE. If you are familiar with shared libraries, this will sound very much like the “position-independent code” (or PIC) that a shared library uses. This is because they are almost identical concepts. A position-independent executable is loaded by the kernel in the same way a shared library would be loaded.\nYou don't need to replace every single binary on your system with a PIE executable. Remember, the purpose here is to protect from remote buffer overflow attacks. Programs that don't communicate over the Internet aren't vulnerable to a remote attack and don't need this extra protection. This author has prepared a set of Slackware 10.1 packages for the server software that is generally most often probed and attacked. These packages, all available from linuxpackages.net, are: apache 1.3.33, sendmail 8.13.3, bind 9.3.0, imapd 4.62, popa3d 0.6.4, portmap 5.0, and proftpd 1.2.10. To use, simply download the packages and use upgradepkg as root to upgrade your current package with the new one:\n$ upgradepkg apache-1.3.33-i486-2Hkf.tgz etc...\nIn the case of packages for software that is currently running, it is suggested that you first shut down such software using its startup script in /etc/rc.d:\n$ /etc/rc.d/rc.bind stop $ /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd stop $ /etc/rc.d/rc.portmap stop $ /etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail stop\nChecking on exec-shield\nOk, there is one slight correction we'll talk about here. When earlier it was said that exec-shield would make the stack and data areas of programs non-executable, this was only partly right. It will do this, but there are certain very rare ways to write a program that requires that the stack and data areas not have this restriction. Whenever gcc detects a program written this way, it will put a flag in the end program telling the system that it must have an executable stack. If gcc doesn't detect a program written this way, it will put in a flag saying it's all right for the program to have a non-executable stack. The exec-shield patch is smart, and will look for these flags and honor them. If the stack flag isn't present at all – say, for a program compiled on a version of gcc prior to this flag being supported, then exec-shield plays it safe and treats the program as if it needs an executable stack and disables exec-shield protection for that program.\nAll the packages included in Slackware 10.1 are compiled with a version of gcc that is recent enough to support the flag and there are not to this author's knowledge any programs included in Slackware 10.1 that require an executable stack. However, it is possible you may run into programs that do require an executable stack or old binaries that don't have any stack flag in them. You will want a way to check programs running on your system to see if exec-shield is enabled for them or not. In addition, you will want to be able to check to see what programs on your system are position-independent executables. A script, called lsexec will allow you to check one or all the processes running on your system. The script will give you information on all running processes or a single process by name or by PID. For example, to get information on all running processes, download the script and, as root, type:\n$ lsexec –all\nFor each running process, you will be told whether the executable is a PIE, and whether or not exec-shield is enabled for it. Remember, exec-shield is enabled if the process doesn't need an executable stack, disabled if it does need one or if it's been produced with an old version of gcc that doesn't support the executable/non-executable stack flag.\nYou will also be given information regarding whether the process is full relro, partial relro, or no relro. That's something that isn't covered here. For the purposes of this article, it suffices to say that making a binary relro goes hand-in-hand with making it a PIE and helps make it more secure. There is further reading at the end of this article for those that want to get more information on the technical details.\nSummary and Caveats\nThere are a few things to remember about exec-shield. It can dramatically increase the security on your system, but it isn't the be-all end-all protection. For one, it cannot make a program invulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack – not if that program has such a weakness in it. What it can do is mitigate the consequences of any such weakness. It makes it orders of magnitude harder for an attacker to take advantage of such a weakness to get control over your system. If a buffer-overflow weakness is found in a version of software you are using, an attacker can probably use that weakness in a denial-of-service attack of some sort. An attacker can probably cause the program to crash – but it's unlikely that the attacker can use the weakness to gain any control over your server.\nAlso to remember, that buffer overflow attacks are only one type of attack. Running exec-shield won't protect you against other types of attacks. It is still just as important to keep up with security advisories and update any programs that have been shown to have any weakness (including buffer overflow weaknesses).\nThat all being said, exec-shield can help make your Slackware system a much more secure server or firewall.\nvan de Ven, Arjan (2004).

The aim is to make even the non-geeks feel comfortable. We will start with the outermost realm, the Firewall.\nWhat is a Firewall?\nA firewall is a part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communications. It is a device or set of devices which is configured to permit or deny computer applications based upon a set of rules and other criteria.\nIn simpler terms, firewall protects your computer from unwanted and unauthorized access to your computer, from the outside. When hooked up on Internet, there are many ways by which a hacker or by some unwanted program may access your system and relay some important data, such as your passwords to your bank accounts or some company document you have. To protect yourself from these vulnerabilities you need a firewall.\nThere are many available choices and most of them are paid. The big names such as Kaspersky, Norton etc are basically Internet Security Suites that gives you all round protection. But if you want to save a few dollars, here are some choices.\n- Ashampoo Firewall\nIts a small, yet very effective, personal firewall. Rather than installing a bundle of applications just for the security, this application installs a single bare bone structure and effectively counters the incoming threats. It has clean UI and different modes for different kind of Users (minimalistic/advanced). It also bundles 4 additional network security tools – Auto Start manager, System Process Monitor, Internet Cleaner and IP spam blocker.\n- Comodo Firewall\nI have personally used this firewall for quite some time now, and to tell you, I was really satisfied by its performance. The UI is a bit tricky to handle and it shows a detailed report of every connection that computer makes and every incoming connection that computer receives, on demand. The firewall detects over 10,000 application of various category as safe spyware or as ad unit. There are some additional features such as, Pop-up blocking, analyzing suspicious file, checksum verification etc.\n- PC Tools Firewall Plus\nPC Tools have been acclaimed for its much intuitive and heuristic antivirus called Threatfire, and now they have come up with another excellent firewall for basic PC users. The minimalistic approach works well for the understanding of the application and helps even the naive users to handle it. There are very few settings and the firewall automatically adjusts itself according to the choices user makes.\n- Online Armor Free Firewall\nOut of all the options available here, Online Armor is the latest and the most detailed firewall with most possible options for a free version. Though there is nothing much to say about the protection, as it does what its supposed to do.

It also dramatically reduces and simplifies data management tasks, allowing more information to be stored in the same technology, rather than continuing to buy more and more storage.\nIn 1998, IBM Researchers unveiled a highly scalable, clustered parallel file system called General Parallel File System (GPFS), which was furthered tuned to make this breakthrough possible. GPFS represents a major advance of scaling for storage performance and capacity, while keeping management costs flat. This innovation could help organizations cope with the exploding growth of data, transactions and digitally-aware sensors and other devices that comprise Smarter Planet systems. It is ideally suited for applications requiring high-speed access to large volumes of data such as data mining to determine customer buying behaviors across massive data sets, seismic data processing, risk management and financial analysis, weather modeling and scientific research.\nDriving New Levels of Storage Performance\nToday's breakthrough was achieved using GPFS running on a cluster of 10 eight core systems and solid state storage, taking 43 minutes to perform this selection. The GPFS management rules engine provides the comprehensive capabilities to service any data management task.\nGPFS's advanced algorithm makes possible the full use of all processor cores on all of these machines in all phases of the task (data read, sorting and rules evaluation). GPFS exploits the solid state storage appliances with only 6.8 terabytes of capacity for excellent random performance and high data transfer rates for containing the metadata storage. The appliances sustainably perform hundreds of millions of data input-output operations, while GPFS continuously identifies, selects and sorts the right set of files among the 10 billion on the system.\n\"Today's demonstration of GPFS scalability will pave the way for new products that address the challenges of a rapidly growing, multi-zettabyte world,\" said Doug Balog, vice president, storage platforms, IBM. \"This has the potential to enable much larger data environments to be unified on a single platform and dramatically reduce and simplify data management tasks such as data placement, aging, backup and migration of individual files.\"\nThe previous record was also set by IBM researchers at the Supercomputing 2007 conference in Reno, NV, where they demonstrated the ability to scan one billion files in three hours.\n\"Businesses in every industry are looking to the future of storage and data management as we face a problem springing from the very core of our success – managing the massive amounts of data we create on a daily basis,\" said Bruce Hillsberg, director of storage systems, IBM Research – Almaden. \"From banking systems to MRIs and traffic sensors, our day-to-day lives are engulfed in data. But, it can only be useful if it is effectively stored, analyzed and applied, and businesses and governments have relied on smarter technology systems as the means to manage and leverage the constant influx of data and turn it into valuable insights.\"\nIBM Research continues to develop innovative storage technologies to help clients not only manage data proliferation, but harness data to create new services. In the past year alone, IBM storage products included over five significant storage innovations invented by IBM Research including IBM Easy Tier, Storwize V7000, Scale-out Network Attached Storage (SONAS), IBM Information Archive and IBM Long Term File System (LTFS).\nAs the size of digital data increased 47 percent over last year, businesses are under tremendous pressure to quickly turn data into actionable insights, but grapple with how to manage and store it all. As new applications emerge in industries from financial services to healthcare, traditional data management systems will be unable to perform common but critical storage management tasks, leaving organizations exposed to critical data loss.\nAnticipating these storage challenges decades ago, researchers from IBM Research – Almaden created GPFS to help businesses cope with the exploding growth of data, transactions and digitally-aware devices on a single system. Already deployed to perform tasks like backup, information lifecycle management, disaster recovery and content distribution, this technology's unique approach overcomes the challenge of managing unprecedented large file systems with the combination of multi-system parallelization and fast access to file system metadata stored on a solid state storage appliance.\nAdditional details on the breakthrough can be found here.\nChemistry, computer science, electrical engineering, materials and mathematical sciences, physics and services science", "label": 1}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Say goodbye to those wimpy, eight-letter passwords.\nThe 12-character era of online security is upon us, according to a report published this week by the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nThe researchers used clusters of graphics cards to crack eight-character passwords in less than two hours.\nBut when the researchers applied that same processing power to 12-character passwords, they found it would take 17,134 years to make them snap.\n\"The length of your password in some cases can dictate the vulnerability,\" said Joshua Davis, a research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.\nIt's hard to say what will happen in the future, but for now, 12-character passwords should be the standard, said Richard Boyd, a senior research scientist who also worked on the project.\nThe researchers recommend 12-character passwords -- as opposed to those with 11 or, say, 13 characters -- because that number strikes a balance between \"convenience and security.\"\nThey assumed a sophisticated hacker might be able to try 1 trillion password combinations per second. In that scenario, it takes 180 years to crack an 11-character password, but there's a big jump when you add just one more character -- 17,134 years.\nPasswords have gotten longer over time, and security experts are already recommending that people use full sentences as passwords.\nHere's one suggested password-sentence from Carnegie Mellon University:\n\"No, the capital of Wisconsin isn't Cheeseopolis!\"\nOr maybe something that's easier to remember, like this:\n\"I have two kids: Jack and Jill.\"\nEven though advances in cheap computing power are making long, complicated passwords a necessity, not all websites will accommodate them, Boyd said.\nIt's best to use the longest and most complex password a site will allow, he said. For example, if a website will let you create a password with non-letter characters -- like \"@y;}v%W$\\5\\\" -- then you should do so.\nThere are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, but there are 95 letters and symbols on a standard keyboard. More characters means more permutations, and it soon becomes more difficult for a computer to generate the correct password just by guessing.\nSome websites allow for super-long passwords. The longest one Boyd has seen is at Fidelity.com, a financial site that lets users create 32-character passwords.\nOn a Microsoft website devoted to password security, the tech giant tells the password-creating public not to use real words or logical combinations of letters. That keeps you safer from a \"dictionary attack,\" which uses a database of words and common character sequences to try to guess the code.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers carried out a \"brute force\" attack when they determined that passwords should be at least 12 characters long.\nTo do so, they deployed computer graphics cards, which are cheap and can be programmed to do basic computations very quickly.\nThe processors in those cards run simultaneously, trying to guess all of the possible password combinations. The more characters in a password, the more guesses are required.\nBut if your password has to be really long in order to keep up with this computational power -- and if you're supposed to have a new password for each website you frequent -- then how are you supposed to remember everything?\nThat's a real problem, the Georgia Tech researchers said.\nThere are a few solutions, however.\nA website called Password Safe will store a list of passwords for you, but Boyd and Davis said it may still be possible for a hacker to obtain that list.\nOther companies sell tokens that people carry around with them. These keychain-sized devices generate random numbers several times a minute, and users must enter those numbers and a shorter password to log in.\nSome sites -- Facebook for example -- are marketing their log-ins and user names as a way to access sites all over the Web.\nThat's good for the user but is potentially dangerous because if hackers figure out a single password, they can access multiple banks of information, the researchers said.\nThe reason passwords have to keep getting longer is that computers and graphics cards are getting faster, the Georgia Tech researchers said.\n\"These things are really inexpensive -- just a few hundred dollars -- and they have a performance that's comparable to supercomputers of only just a few years ago,\" Boyd said of fast-processing graphics cards.\nMaybe our brains will have to get bigger and faster, too. We'll need some way to remember these tome-like character strings.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Bruce Lawson, open web standards evangelist for Opera, looks at some nifty new browser technologies that are not part of HTML5, including WebGL and SVG\nRecently, Rich Clark, my fellow HTML5 Doctor, took you on a short tour of HTML5 APIs and, before signing off, pointed you towards a bewildering page called The Web platform: Browser technologies containing two long columns of small text saying scary things like \"window.crypto.getRandomValues\" and \"DOM mutation observers\".\nDon't worry, we're not going to look at all of those: some are so far from being finalised that it'll be a while before we see them in browsers. But some are already in browsers near you, or coming soon. People will call them \"HTML5\". They're not. But they are NEWT (New Exciting Web Technologies) that you should be keeping half an eye on.\nWebGL stands for Web-based Graphics Library, and is managed by the non-profit Khronos Group. It's used in conjunction with the HTML5\n<canvas> element to produce 3D graphics.\nNevertheless, there are resources to help you learn WebGL – and it's not just for games; we've seen fancy graphics, visualisatons and music videos made with it. Ones I can personally recommend are:\n- Introduction to WebGL and a look at the libraries available, by Luz Caballero.\n- Raw WebGL 101 – for those who think using a library is an admission of failure.\n- Learning WebGL – a very good tutorial site.\n- WebGL 101 – an instructional video by Erik Möller (2.5 hours).\n- See Emberwind, a game ported to webGL by Erik Möller. You can fork it on Github, or just see the code.\nWebGL is present in all desktop browsers (released or dev channel) except for IE10 (Microsoft has said it won't support it). On mobile, it's released in Opera Mobile 12 final on Android, Blackberry Playbook 2.0, Nokia N900, Sony Ericsson Xperia Android phones and in development builds of Firefox Mobile.\nScalable Vector Graphics have been around for ages in Opera, Firefox, Safari and Chrome, but it wasn't until Internet Explorer began supporting it in IE9 that it became ready for primetime use, by which point it's been somewhat overshadowed by HTML5 <canvas>, although they are different tools for different jobs.\nBecause shapes and paths are described with markup, they can be styled with CSS. Unlike\n<canvas>, text in SVG remains text and is therefore indexable, mash-upabble and accessible; in canvas, text just turns into pixels, like a Photoshop image of text.\nBut the real killer feature of SVG is that it's vector based – so your illustrations, graphs, UI icons and so on, will be just as clear and sharp on a 50 inch widescreen web-enabled TV as they will on a phone screen or desktop. In these web-anywhere days, that's important. SVG images can even include Media Queries so can be responsive, dropping nuances of shading or detail when you get down to small sizes, for example.\nAs mentioned above, there is wide support for SVG on the latest desktop browsers. Mobile support is also generally good, with the exception of the stock browser for Android before version 3.0.\nUnlike many of the APIs that are erroneously called \"HTML5\", there's an excuse with getUserMedia – it started life as the HTML5 <device> element before becoming renamed and then hived off to the W3C's WebRTC suite of specifications.\ngUM (as we shall now call it) allows access to a user's camera and microphone. I mentioned that it's part of the webRTC suite of specifications, which will enable peer-to-peer in-browser video conferencing. As gUM has other uses, too, it's separated out.\nCamera access is implemented in Opera 12 final on Android, in Opera Desktop Labs and in Google Chrome Canary builds. Neither Opera nor Chrome yet implements microphone access.\nOnce video is streaming from the device, it can be made the source of a\n<video> element, which can be positioned off-screen if necessary, and then copied into\n<canvas> and manipulated as required. Paul Neave's HTML5 webcam toy copies the streaming data into WebGL in order to manipulate it (I interviewed him about this in issue 226 of .net magazine).\ngUM goes a long way to giving web apps the same functionality as native apps. Trying Neave's gUM and WebGL demo on Opera Mobile 12 feels as responsive and snappy as platform-specific apps. As the functionality becomes widespread in production browsers, I predict lots of web-based QR code-readers and augmented reality apps.\nThis spec \"provides an API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data\". For example, you can upload files into the browser and find out information such as name, size and type without having to go to the server. You can also open the file and manipulate its contents. This can enhance interactivity of browser-based applications to make them more like desktop applications.\nOne common use is to make a traditional image upload dialogue more Web 2.0-tastic by allowing dragging and dropping into the browser rather than navigating through the file system.\nYou start off with a normal\n<input type=\"file\">, then progressively enhance it. Feature detect for HTML5 Drag and Drop support and, if present, replace the\n<input> with a\n<div> that will be a drag target for your image. When the image is dragged into the drag target, use the File Reader API to show a thumbnail of the image. See Remy Sharp's demo.\nThere are also specs for writing files and manipulating file systems, but these aren't sufficiently cross-browser to be currently usable.\n- The W3C file API – a very basic introduction by yours truly.\n- Exploring the FileSystem APIs – HTML5 Rocks article (Chrome-only).\nFeature-detecting, progressive enhancement and upgrade messages\nOf course, we should always try to progressively enhance basic, semantic HTML so that, if fancy APIs and the like are unavailable, the site still works. But sometimes, that's not possible. For example, with Paul Neave's HTML5 webcam toy, if gUM and WebGL aren't present, the website can't really take remedial action – the whole point of the site is lost.\nIn this case, there are typically two conventions: either show a message that says \"Your browser is rubbish. Goodbye\", or say \"You need to use Chrome 6/ Firefox 4/ Opera 10 [insert your favourite browser that supports the technologies you're using]\".\nThe first is unhelpful and just rude; it admonishes without suggesting a remedy. The second is a transient snapshot; in six months time, every other browser might support the tech you're using, yet your message is long out-of-date. Nothing suggests an abandoned site like telling the user to come back with Firefox 4 when they're visiting with Firefox 7.\nIf you really, really can't use progressive enhancement, then use the new HTML5 Please API. Created by Jon Neal, Divya Manian, and others, it interrogates caniuse.com and returns a list of the latest browsers that support the features you need:\nIf you've created a demo or site that requires Canvas or WebSQL DB, you've been in the awkward situation of telling some of your visitors that their browser isn't good enough. But you can't just recommend they get a browser with those features; for example, \"Get a WebRTC capable browser\" is pretty much useless to everyone.\nThe HTML5 Please API translates developer language (features) to user language (browsers). Call the API and you get back some HTML to show the user or a JSON object of the relevant data (with browser logos and all), so you can customise what you show to users.\nWhat's particularly pleasant about this approach is that, if the API determines that all the features are supported by a newer version of the viewer's current browser, it suggests upgrading that rather than asking the user to change browser just to view your page.\nThat's all, folks\nAs you've seen there are loads of exciting technologies coming just around the corner. By the time you've come to grips with the ones we've discussed above, it'll be time to worry about a whole load more. Have fun; remember to test in as many browsers as possible.\nPicture of newt by Rob Winter, newt/HTML5 illustration by Mike Brennan.", "label": 1}

This type of software is not malicious in itself, but is used by malware creators to cover their tracks in infected systems. There are types of malware that use rootkits to hide their presence on a system.\nIn 2005, the first examples of malware that used rootkits (as external tools or techniques within its code) emerged in order to evade detection. Bots, adware and spyware added these characteristics to their own, a trend that has continued to increase.\nSimilarly, these programs go hand-in-glove with the new cyber-crime malware dynamic: for malware to be exploited for financial gain, stealth is vitally important. Rootkits enable malware to remain hidden on a computer for much longer without being detected.\nThis is a technique or program that exploits a security flaw -a vulnerability- in a certain communication protocol, operating system or IT tool.\nThis flaw allows operations that can cause abnormal functioning of the application and can be caused intentionally by malicious users, allowing them to execute code remotely, launch denial of service attacks, disclose information or escalate privileges.\nAdware programs display advertisements associated to the products or services offered by the creator of the program or third-parties. Adware can be installed in a number of ways, in some occasions without users’ consent, and either with or without users’ knowledge of its function.\nThe classification of this type of program is controversial, as there are those who consider it a type of spyware.

{"text": "Every day you share personal information about yourself with others. It’s so routine that you may not even realize you’re doing it. You may write a check at the grocery store, charge tickets to a ball game, rent a car, mail your tax returns, buy a gift online, call home on your cell phone, schedule a doctor’s appointment or apply for a credit card.\nEach transaction requires you to share personal information: your bank and credit card account numbers; your income; your Social Security number (SSN); or your name, address, and phone numbers.\nIt’s important to find out what happens to the personal information you and your children provide to companies, marketers, and government agencies. These organizations may use your information simply to process your order; to tell you about products, services, or promotions; or to share with others.\nAnd then there are unscrupulous individuals, like identity thieves, who want your information to commit fraud. Identity theft -- the fastest-growing white-collar crime in America -- occurs when someone steals your personal identifying information, like your SSN, birth date, or mother’s maiden name, to open new charge accounts, order merchandise, or borrow money.\nConsumers targeted by identity thieves usually don’t know they’ve been victimized. But when the fraudsters fail to pay the bills or repay the loans, collection agencies begin pursuing the consumers to cover debts they didn’t even know they had.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) encourages you to make sure your transactions -- online and off -- are secure and your personal information is protected. The FTC offers these tips to help you manage your personal information wisely, and to help minimize its misuse:\n- Put passwords on your all your accounts, including your credit card account, and your bank and phone accounts. Avoid using easily available information -- like your mother’s maiden name, your birth date, the last four digits of your SSN, or your phone number -- or obvious choices, like a series of consecutive numbers or your hometown football team.\n- Minimize the identification information and the number of cards you carry to what you’ll actually need. Don’t put all your identifying information in one holder in your purse, briefcase, or backpack.\n- Keep items with personal information in a safe place. When you discard receipts, copies of credit applications, insurance forms, physician statements, bank checks and statements, expired charge cards, credit offers you get in the mail, and mailing labels from magazines, tear or shred them. That will help thwart any identity thief who may pick through your trash or recycling bins to capture your personal information.\n- Order a copy of your credit report.

{"text": "Each bulletin has one or more patches to fix critical security issues, some of which are already being exploited. Three bulletins discuss attacks that can be used to take over computers without any user interaction. The remaining bulletins warn about client-side vulnerabilities, which can be attacked when a user visits an evil website or opens a malformed document.\nRemote attacks (or server-side attacks) can be performed against desktops, laptops or servers running services such as the file and printing services or Web services. An attacker can send malicious packets to the TCP ports running these services. Once the packets are received, they are usually coded to take actions such as adding user accounts, installing backdoors or shutting down the system entirely.\nSince file, printing and Web services are intended to be available to remote users, the TCP ports are also open to exploits. Attackers can launch exploit code at any time, and unlike the client-side attacks discussed below, users don't need to be on their systems for an attack to be successful. Server-side attacks are commonly turned into worms because they don't require any user interaction to spread.\n- MS09-050 should be immediately installed on your Vista and Windows Server 2008 systems. This patch fixes a problem that attackers can use to send packets to these machines and either cause them to stop working or execute code. No authentication is required -- the attacker needs only to send packets to TCP Ports 139 or 445. Since these file- and printer-sharing ports are typically blocked at a corporate firewall, attacks are more likely to originate from internal users. Exploit code for this vulnerability is circulating on the Internet, so attacks could be imminent. A reboot should be performed after installing this patch.\n- MS09-053 patches a flaw in the FTP service in Internet Information Services (IIS) 5, 6 and 7. This vulnerability can allow attackers to take any actions they want against IIS 5 machines running the FTP service, including executing code, adding user accounts, deleting files and modifying websites. For IIS 6 and 7 machines, the attacker could cause the FTP service to stop functioning but would not be able to take any other actions on those systems. Exploit code for this issue has been posted on the Internet, and attacks have been identified at customer sites.\n- MS09-059 is a patch to prevent attackers from remotely rebooting computers. This flaw is present only if the previously suggested -- but not required -- Patch KB968389 has been installed. If this patch is present and the attacker can send NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication packets for file and printer sharing, IIS, FTP, Telnet, etc., the attacker can cause your computer to restart.\nClient-side attacks are most often initiated when a user visits a malicious website or opens a malformed document such as an Excel worksheet or an email. The attack can't happen unless the user takes one of these actions or executes specific attack code on his own computer.\nOf the nine bulletins discussed below, seven relate to viewing content on malicious websites, one is specific to running exploit code on your own computer, and one can be used to entice users to provide sensitive information to a bogus website.\n- MS09-051 fixes a flaw in the handling of Windows Media content. Visiting an evil website can trigger this attack without any further user interaction. The attacker can take actions on the computer with the same level of permission as the currently logged-on user. All operating systems are affected by this vulnerability except Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. This vulnerability is more complicated to remedy because up to three different patches must be installed on each Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 system to protect them.\n- MS09-052 is a similar vulnerability to MS09-051 but is specific to Windows Media Player on Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003 systems. That means up to four patches must be installed on these systems to protect them from malicious media attacks.\n- MS09-054 is a patch for all versions of Internet Explorer. This patch corrects a flaw that would allow malicious websites to take actions on visiting computers, including accessing or deleting data to which the logged-on user has access. Simply viewing a bad website can cause these actions to occur. This patch is cumulative and fixes all prior known Internet Explorer security issues.\n- MS09-057 is a similar exploit scenario to MS09-054: Visit an evil website and the attacker can perform actions on your system with the same level of permissions as the currently logged-on user. In this instance, the flaw resides in the Indexing service on Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003 systems.\n- MS09-055 is a cumulative update that blocks all known malicious ActiveX controls from executing. This patch builds upon the previously released MS09-035 patch and adds support to block attacks against Office Web Components, the Visio Viewer control, Windows Live Mail control and the MSN Photo Upload tool. MS09-060 is a similar patch that protects against attacks aimed at Microsoft Office products.\n- MS09-056 fixes a problem with certificate handling by clients and servers. In a very complicated scenario, it an attacker could setup a secure lookalike website and direct your user's computers to that website. Although it appears that the user is connected to a legitimate website because the Secure Sockets Layer padlock icon is present, they may actually be connecting to a rogue website set up to collect personal information.\n- MS09-058 fixes a privilege-elevation vulnerability. This flaw would enable someone with user-level permissions on his computer to execute a piece of code that would effectively make him an administrator on his local computer. Privilege-elevation attacks usually require that the attacker be sitting in front of the computer that he wishes to target or be connected via Remote Desktop or Terminal Services.\n- MS09-062 provides protection when viewing images on evil websites. When viewed, these malicious graphics can execute code on a system and take any action that the currently logged-on user can perform. There are multiple patches required to fix this vulnerability based on the type of applications installed on your system (such as Office or SQL Server).\nI recommend installing the patches for MS09-050 and 09-053 immediately, since exploit code has been released for these vulnerabilities, and the potential effect of exploitation is serious. Install the IE patch (MS09-054), media-related patches (MS09-051 and MS09-052), Indexing patch (MS09-057), ActiveX patches (MS09-055 and MS09-060), and image-rendering patch (MS09-062) to all end-user systems as soon as possible, followed by MS09-056 and MS09-058 soon thereafter.\nIt's a lot of patches, but also a lot of security issues to address.\n|ABOUT THE AUTHOR:|\nEric Schultze is an independent security consultant who most recently designed Microsoft patch management solutions at Shavlik Technologies.

{"text": "OpenSSL is a powerful Secure Sockets Layer cryptographic library. Apache uses it for HTTPS encryption, and OpenSSH uses it for SSH encryption. But, you don't have to use it as a library. It's also a multipurpose, cross-platform crypto tool.\nHere's a little background on OpenSSL. Before OpenSSL, there was ssleay, an SSL implementation written by Eric A. Young. It was successively improved and eventually became OpenSSL, similar to how NCSA HTTPd became the Apache Web server. Today, OpenSSL supports dozens of cryptographic algorithms and protocols with hundreds of options.\nOpenSSL has a lot of features. In addition to the SSL client and server features, OpenSSL also has:\nUS federal government NIST FIPS 140-2 Level 1 validation.\nTLS, the next generation of SSL.\nX.509 key and certificate generation.\nX.509 certificate authority.\nFile encryption and hashing.\nUNIX password hashes.\nNine different commercial cryptographic hardware devices.\nCryptographic performance testing.\nSix message digest algorithms.\nNine cipher algorithms with four block modes (where applicable).\nMultiple crypto protocols.\nAlthough OpenSSL is complex, a lot of that complexity can be avoided. The remainder of this article concentrates on features that are easy to use, and in only a few lines of shell code.\nThis article uses the same section titles as in my earlier GnuPG article (“GnuPG Hacks”, Linux Journal, March 2006, page 52) to make it easier to compare OpenSSL and GnuPG.\nFirst, let's confirm that OpenSSL is installed and in your path. Many Linux distributions, even some small distributions, include OpenSSL. Usually OpenSSL is located in /usr/bin/, like most bundled packages.\nIn all of the examples, the shell prompt is set to $.\n$ openssl version\nNote that there are no leading dashes for the version option.\nYou should get something like this:\nOpenSSL 0.9.7d 17 Mar 2004\nThe exact version number, date and other details may vary. At the time of this writing, the current version is OpenSSL 0.9.8a. The examples we're using should work for most versions of OpenSSL.\nIf you typed openssl with no command-line option, you'll get this:\nIf this happens, simply type quit or press Ctrl-C to exit safely. It's only the OpenSSL internal command-line prompt. It doesn't have command-line editing and has no explicit help function. But, it will type a list of commands if you type a command it doesn't know. It's better to avoid it for now.\nBinary files typically are sent in e-mail using MIME. However, if your e-mail software doesn't support MIME, like most command-line e-mail, you're stuck with uuencode, or you can use OpenSSL's base64 encoding. Base64 is the same encoding used by the much more complicated MIME protocol, but it's not directly MIME-compatible.\nTo wrap a file in base64 text encoding, type:\n$ openssl base64 < filename.bin > filename.txt\nTo unwrap a base64-encoded file, type:\n$ openssl base64 -d < filename.txt > filename.bin\nNote that OpenSSL doesn't care about the filename extension.\nOpenSSL, unlike GnuPG or MIME, also can encode short strings, as follows:\n$ echo \"The Linux Journal\" | openssl base64 VGhlIExpbnV4IEpvdXJuYWwK\nDecoding is similar:\n$ echo \"VGhlIExpbnV4IEpvdXJuYWwK\" | openssl base64 -d The Linux Journal\nsum and cksum are the traditional UNIX checksum programs. They work fine, as long as as you don't need cross-platform compatibility or security, and you don't mind that occasionally two completely different files will have the same checksum value.\nAlthough Linux systems often have md5sum installed, the MD5 algorithm suffers from a relatively new vulnerability and shouldn't be used anymore.\nIf it's installed, the more secure sha1sum should be used. Several different programs go by this name, however. Some versions can hash only one file at a time, some can't handle stdin or have some other deficiency. If you run into any of these problems or simply want consistent, known, good cross-platform software, consider OpenSSL.\nThe OpenSSL hash output format is a bit different from GnuPG, but numerically identical. OpenSSL format always identifies the algorithm used and also outputs a lowercase hexadecimal string with no whitespace. Some find this format easier to use.\nHere are some examples:\n$ openssl sha1 filename SHA1(filename)= e83a42b9bc8431a6645099be50b6341a35d3dceb $ openssl md5 filename MD5(filename)= 26e9855f8ad6a5906fea121283c729c4\nAs in my previous “GnuPG Hacks” article, the above examples use a file that contains the string: “The Linux Journal”. Note that there is no period in the string.\nIf you have a problem replicating these results, here is the ASCII-annotated hexadecimal representation of the file. Note the newline at the end automatically added by vi:\nT h e L i n u x J o u r n a l \\n 54 68 65 20 4c 69 6e 75 78 20 4a 6f 75 72 6e 61 6c 0a\nOpenSSL, unlike GnuPG, doesn't have SHA-512, but OpenSSL does have MD2, MD4 and MDC2. These are older algorithms that are provided for backward compatibility. Like MD5, they shouldn't be used anymore.\n|Designing Electronics with Linux||May 22, 2013|\n|Dynamic DNS—an Object Lesson in Problem Solving||May 21, 2013|\n|Using Salt Stack and Vagrant for Drupal Development||May 20, 2013|\n|Making Linux and Android Get Along (It's Not as Hard as It Sounds)||May 16, 2013|\n|Drupal Is a Framework: Why Everyone Needs to Understand This||May 15, 2013|\n|Home, My Backup Data Center||May 13, 2013|\n- New Products\n- Linux Systems Administrator\n- Senior Perl Developer\n- Technical Support Rep\n- UX Designer\n- Designing Electronics with Linux\n- Dynamic DNS—an Object Lesson in Problem Solving\n- Making Linux and Android Get Along (It's Not as Hard as It Sounds)\n- Using Salt Stack and Vagrant for Drupal Development\n- Nice article, thanks for the\n7 hours 9 min ago\n- I once had a better way I\n12 hours 55 min ago\n- Not only you I too assumed\n13 hours 13 min ago\n- another very interesting\n15 hours 6 min ago\n- Reply to comment | Linux Journal\n16 hours 59 min ago\n- Reply to comment | Linux Journal\n23 hours 53 min ago\n- Reply to comment | Linux Journal\n1 day 9 min ago\n- Favorite (and easily brute-forced) pw's\n1 day 2 hours ago\n- Have you tried Boxen?

With its flexibility and multitude of options, it is easy to over or under provision the server infrastructure, resulting in poor performance and high TCO. Join us for an in depth, technical discussion with industry experts from leading Hadoop and server companies who will provide insights into the key considerations for designing and deploying an optimal Hadoop cluster.\nSome of key questions to be discussed are:\n- What is the “typical” Hadoop cluster and what should be installed on the different machine types?\n- Why should you consider the typical workload patterns when making your hardware decisions?\n- Are all microservers created equal for Hadoop deployments?\n- How do I plan for expansion if I require more compute, memory, storage or networking?", "label": 1}
{"text": "“Where does Windows store this password?” “Is it safe there?”\nI regularly get asked these questions, and they frequently appear on forums.\nMicrosoft has developed several technologies to store and protect credentials, and to add to the confusion, Microsoft has renamed some of these technologies over the years…\nLast question I read was: where does runas /savecred store the password? It gets stored in Stored User Names and Passwords. Before storing the password:\nNirsoft has a tool (CredView) to dump passwords stored in Stored User Names and Passwords:\nThe CredRead function (used by CredView) will not retrieve Windows passwords (domain and local) unless it is called from the LSA process. That’s why CredView doesn’t display the testrunas password (data).\nIf you convert CredView to a DLL and inject it in the LSA process, you’ll be able to retrieve the passwords.

{"text": "PART 3 IN A 3-PART SERIES\nThey have infected perhaps 100 million computers with viruses, turning the PCs around the world into an army of willing criminal assistants known as \"bots.\" They are using those PCs to send out billions of spam e-mails and make millions of dollars by attacking Web sites and extorting their owners. They have even attacked the core computers that keep the Internet running smoothly. Who are they?\nThe answer to that question is elusive, but there are a few clues.\nIn part one of this series, we described the epidemic of hijacked computers that's swept the Internet. Controlled by malicious programs, the computers are turned into robots, or bots, that are directed by criminals known as bot herders.\nPart two looked at how profitable the bot business has become, leading hackers to engage in gang warfare in cyberspace for control of these hijacked computers -- a digital battle that has spilled out onto the Internet's Main Street.\nToday, we examine who is behind these networks of infected computers.\nFor years, computer hackers typically were precocious, anti-social teen-agers who committed digital violence just to get attention. But computer crime has grown up, and grown into a big business. Now it is used by highly organized gangs to steal millions of dollars.\nThe top gangs, most agree, are in Russia, Eastern Europe and Brazil, although there also are a few up-and-coming cybercrime syndicates in Asia.\nCybercriminals tend to be talented computer programmers who can make much more money stealing than working, the experts agree. There is so much money to be made in cybercrime that some observers speculate that terrorists are using it to raise money and support their organizations.\nComputer security experts disagree on whether terrorists are involved in cybercrime, but there is one sure sign that computer crime has become a much more sober affair: Many experts interviewed for this story shied away from talking about the topic of who's behind botnets, pointing to concerns for family safety.\n\"When I got into this, it was kind of a game,\" said one expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Now, it's very serious. I wouldn't want my name attached (to comments about the topic).\"\nThat's a new sentiment in an industry that has often been criticized for using hyperbole to generate publicity.\nRecruited by professionals\nBot herders are still typically young – perhaps 18 to 25 -- often only a little bit older than a teenage hacker, says David Marcus, security research and communications manager with McAfee. They are nearly always men. And they often live in an area where traditional, big-money computing jobs are difficult to find.\n\"There are limited ways to make money,\" he said. \"This is the way for them to make a lot.\" Marcus said he thinks organized crime is behind a lot of bot activity, but Mafiosi aren't coding Trojan horse programs. Instead, their money funds hacker operations and is used to recruit computer savvy youngsters, he believes.\nCLICK FOR RELATED CONTENT\n\"They watch for bright kids and they start them on small tasks, like 'Find me 100 passwords and I'll give you 1,000 rubles,'\" he said.\nIn more aggressive recruitment programs, organized crime will actually pay for a computer geek to get through college, essentially a hacker scholarship, said Marcus.\nSome say there are as many as 45,000 different botnets sending out spam and being used for other cybercrimes, but Professor Randy Vaughn of Baylor University said he believes there are as few as six or seven major bot gangs and as few as 1,000 criminals controlling all the infected computers.\n\"And the number of genuine genius bot programmers is probably much smaller than that,\" he said. \"In each group there are a few geniuses and there are a bunch of groupies who hang around on the botnet and attempt to gain credibility with the botnet operators.\"\nThe groupies hope to learn enough that they can control their own vast botnets, but in the meantime they act as money handlers or perform other menial tasks for the \"genius\" programmers, Vaughn said.\nBot herders aren't necessarily spammers, but the two are often linked, as virtually all spam is now sent from hijacked computers, experts say.\nThe Spamhaus top 10 list of worst spammers is now populated by Russians, Ukrainians and a Chinese ring.\nCraig Schiller, a professor at Portland State University and author of \"Botnets: The Killer Web Applications,\" said those who designed the Internet wanted a system that would allow buyers and sellers to connect from around the globe. They had no idea that the network would become a platform for global crime, he said.\n\"This is the e-commerce that people dreamed about but didn't realize it was a nightmare,\" said Schiller.\nThe arrest of three Russian bot herders last year offers a rare glimpse into the world where such nightmares are born.\nThree men -- Alexander Petrov, Denis Stepanov and Ivan Maksakov – spent a year terrorizing e-commerce sites as part of a ring of 16 criminals. The ring used armies of computers to overwhelm gambling Web sites and other firms that could ill-afford Internet down time, then extorted money from the operators to halt the traffic flood.\nMikko Hypponen, a security expert at F-Secure, acted as a consultant to one victim, an online CD and DVD retailer. The store eventually paid a ransom of $40,000 to get its site back, he said.\nIn all, the hackers took in about $3.9 million in payments, according to evidence presented at their trial.\n\"And many companies invested much, much more paying to build a defense against these attacks,\" Hypponen said. Russian media estimated the total damages caused by the group at $79 million.\nThe ransom money was wired in small amounts to 10 different bank accounts in Riga, Latvia, Hypponen said. So-called \"money mules\" – middle men who simply help move stolen money from one account to another, usually crossing borders along the way – picked it up from these accounts and wired the money to accounts in St. Petersburg or Moscow.\nAnother set of mules eventually brought the money to the small city of Balakov in western Russia. It was in Balakov that Maksakov, a 22-year-old student at the Balakov Institute of Engineering, Technology and Management, issued orders for the botnet attacks, according to Russian media reports. But while the orders were given in Balakov, the main computer server that controlled the attack was in Houston.\nRussian police nabbed the threesome with the help of Scotland Yard by following the money trail, Hypponen said.\nThe three Russians were sentenced to eight years apiece in jail by a Balakov court last fall. But Hypponen said most of the gang remains at large, including several suspects in Kazakhstan.\nTheir exploits don't rival those of Brazilian gangs, experts say. In 2005, more than 50 Brazilians were arrested after allegedly stealing $33 million with targeted, Trojan horse program that stole online banking passwords.\nDomingo Montanaro, a computer forensics expert and banking consultant in Sao Paolo, Brazil, said Internet crime gangs there operate almost with impunity. In a recent case, he said, he helped nab a ring of 100 criminals that had gained access to 10,000 Brazilian bank accounts.\n\"Criminals in Brazil do some incredible stuff because police cannot fight them anymore,\" he said. \"They are not even using techniques to hide themselves. We only arrest maybe 3 or 4 percent of them.\"\nDriven by revenge\nSome attacks are driven by revenge as well as financial gain.\nLast year, a noted Russian spammer nicknamed PharmaMaster – he usually advertises pharmaceuticals – felt his business was endangered by a Silicon Valley anti-spam startup named Blue Security.\nPharmaMaster initiated an attack that crippled Blue Security's Web site. The firm countered by placing information about the attack on its corporate blog, hosted by popular blog site TypePad, owned by Six Apart Ltd. PharmaMaster then hired a bot herder to conduct a denial-of-service attack that shut down all of Six Apart's blogs, including those hosted on its Typepad.com service.\nEventually, Blue Security surrendered and got out of the business of anti-spam software.\n\"PharmaMaster paid $1 million to take out Blue Security,\" or about $2,000 an hour for the attack, said Schiller, the Portland State professor. \"But (PharmaMaster) was making $3 million a month, so it was worth it.\"\nAt the time, security experts said the Blue Security attack was so severe that only a few of the world's largest corporations would have been able to withstand it.\nGiven the power that the bot herders wield, questions inevitably arise about whether terrorists are behind such crimes. There is no clear answer, and security experts are divided on the issue.\nThe discussion was energized by Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan last month, when she issued a report describing the recent arrest of about 50 hackers in Egypt and Lebanon.\n\"My hypothesis is that the computer brains are still in Russia and Eastern Europe, but some of their operations are being financed by terror organizations. I am hearing that,\" she said. \"If you were terrorists, wouldn't you get in touch with these guys?\"\nHypponen disagrees, saying there isn't any evidence that terrorists are playing with bot networks.\n\"Sure it could happen some day. But I don't have any information, or even any hearsay, that links this to terrorism,\" he said.\nThere is plenty of evidence that organizations like al-Qaida are willing to use the Internet to get attention or to communicate, counters Schiller.\n\"I'd be surprised if (terrorists) weren't using these (botnets),\" he said. \"In their charters they talk about using terrorism to further their aims. They are inclined to use technology against us; it is a huge force multiplier for them.\"\nBotnets are indeed a textbook example of a \"force multiplier\" -- one computer, telling 100 other computers, telling 10,000 others computers to attack someone or something.\nThat makes it inevitable that terrorists bent on disrupting communications and financial systems will at least attempt to harness their power.\nBut while terrorism's link to botnets is tenuous at best, there is no doubt that real-world criminals already are using them to make big money. And given the alarm bells being rung in almost all corners of the computer security world, it seems likely that the botnet problem is going to get worse before it gets better.\nAre you infected?

{"text": "With school out and kids spending more and more time online, keep them safe. June is Internet Safety Month.\n1. Your information is private. Parents should make sure their kids are not sharing personal information on social networking sites that might endanger them or family members and friends. The same goes for online games and other applications.\n2. Take a few minutes to monitor. The best approach is for parents to monitor what their kids are doing online, Verizon security expert Baker suggests, and don’t just assume they’re doing all the right things.\n3. Free downloads aren’t always free or safe. A recent study by Verizon security partner McAfee indicates that online media is one of the biggest moneymakers for cybercriminals. With demand for online music, movies, television and more at an all-time high, it is an attractive venue for crooks. The McAfee study counsels against searching for free content because of the potential risk associated with some sites carrying such content. For example, the study found that using the word “free” when searching for ringtones resulted in a threefold increase in the risk of visiting sites returned by major search engines in English.\nBesides the fact that downloading free music or movies from suspect sites may be illegal, it could also lead to viruses and other malware being downloaded to a family computer.\n4. Find great resources. While June is Internet Safety Month, there are great resources available year-round. The Verizon Parental Controls Center features links to many free resources for parents, educators and kids to help families manage the digital experience that is right for them. In addition to free controls for computers and other devices, the Verizon Parental Controls Center provides insight on such topical issues as cyberbullying, online gaming and managing online privacy. The site also links to public service sites such asWiredSafety.org and Webwisekids.org and educational resources from Verizon Foundation’s Thinkfinity.org website. Verizon is also engaged in the STOP. THINK. CONNECT. campaign, the national effort by government and industry, led by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) and the Anti-Phishing Working Group, to educate people about how to stay safe and secure online. In addition to the campaign, the NCSA offers a host of resources, tips and information for parents and educators.\n5. Have a clearly defined set of rules. Kids have just spent the better part of the year following the rules at school, so a few house rulesduring the summer shouldn’t be onerous.\n6. Talk to your children about how they use technology. It’s easy to get caught up in our busy lives and neglect the opportunity to ask children about what they do online or to discuss such topics as inappropriate content and cyberbullying.\n7. Install Internet filters. Whether they’re looking for it or stumble upon it while browsing, kids can be exposed to inappropriate online content; so make sure you have the latest net filters installed and activated. Schools have them, and they can helpful in the home.\n8. Make sure your online security tools are up to date. You need online security tools to protect your family from accidentallydownloading viruses, worms and other online threats. You should also determine how comprehensive your protection is. Will it protect from phishing and spyware? Does it include security for your home Wi-Fi network or a customizable firewall?\n9. Keep your files safe with online backup. When all else fails, backing up important files — photos and movies, music, documents, etc. – will help minimize the impact of a cyberattack or computer failure.\n10. Give kids alternatives. Encourage your children to participate in worthwhile traditional activities such as sports, dance, camp or extracurricular classes. Some children will do better with structured activities and others may prefer to be self-directed, but you should help your children find something that keeps them from sitting in front of a computer all day.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Some were pranksters, too. In the 1970s, before they founded Apple, Steve Jobs and his buddy Steve Wozniak figured out how to break into telephone systems and make free phone calls. In one infamous prank, the two Steves dialed up the Vatican to find out who would pick up.\n\"Wozniak pretended to be Henry Kissinger wanting to speak to the pope. 'Ve are at de summit meeting in Moscow, and we need to talk to the pope,' Woz intoned. He was told that it was 5:30 a.m. and the pope was sleeping,\" writes Walter Isaacson in his recent biography of Jobs.\nIt wasn't until the 1980s and '90s that hacking took a bad turn. Some blame Robert Morris, a computer science student who discovered a vulnerability in the Internet's inner workings and unleashed the world's first computer worm in 1988.\n\"He essentially brought the Internet to a grinding halt,\" says D'Ovidio, the criminal justice professor. Morris was the first person charged under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that had been enacted two years earlier.\nThen came movies like 1983's \"War Games,\" which also fueled the public's fear of hacking. In the film, a hacker unwittingly comes close to starting the next World War, thinking it's all a computer game.\n\"It happened because of Hollywood and because there was no other word out there,\" says Andrew Howard, 28, a research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. \"Hacker is a cool word, right? It's a neat-sounding word.\"\nThe '80s and '90s were also a time when computers spread from geek circles to office cubicles and home desktops. They were becoming mainstream. But they were still mysterious to most people. They wondered: \"How do they work? Is someone going to break into them?\"\nZuckerberg's hacker manifesto is a nod to Levy, who codified \"The Hacker Ethic\" in his book about the subculture. Among the principles: \"Hackers should be judged by their hacking\" and \"Always yield to the hands-on imperative.\"\nThe hands-on imperative is important to Facebook. Zuckerberg still spends hours writing computer code, even though he has hired hundreds of engineers.\nThat ethos helped Zuckerberg's social network to prosper. As the once mighty MySpace stopped innovating, its users flocked to the cleaner, crisper, always-changing Facebook. News Corp. gave up on MySpace and sold it for $35 million last June. Meanwhile, Facebook's user base ballooned to 845 million, even as the website has gone through changes and redesigns that have angered members and privacy advocates.\nZuckerberg and others may yet be able to clean up the term. Meetup's Hamblen thinks it's already happening.\n\"People aren't as afraid of technology, which was driving the fear of hackers,\" he says. \"It was someone doing something with software that you don't understand. As people become more comfortable with technology in general, then hacking becomes a way of seeing it as using it in a clever way.\"\nTechnology companies, from the tiniest startups to those such as Facebook and online game maker Zynga, take the hacker ethic to heart. They host regular \"hackathons,\" where engineers pull caffeine-fueled all-nighters writing computer code, usually working together on projects that are not part of their day-to-day jobs. Some of Facebook's biggest features, including chat, video and the new Timeline, came out of these hackathons, as Zuckerberg explained in the filing.\n\"Hackers believe that the best idea and implementation should always win — not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people,\" he writes.\nThis is the ethic that can lift fresh-faced college grads (or dropouts) to the highest echelons of the technology elite, or at least to a good job.\nCadir Lee, the chief technology officer at Zynga, the company behind the biggest games on Facebook, says he \"absolutely\" refers to himself as a hacker. Lee says, at Zynga the hacker way means being agile. It's not the end of the world, say, if a game isn't perfect when players first see it, or if it has a bug that needs to be fixed. Think of it as live TV, Lee suggests.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Find one clean computer in the world, and I’ll show you three more that are riddled by viruses and malware. Most of us in the world are now aware of the issues that arise like the slow downs and the security problems, but when we use anti-viruses and protection, how does this problematic software make it through to our operating systems?\nThe hard truth is that most virus and malware issues are caused by the human element. People have a tendency to click on links and emails that contain embedded malicious software. This is normally not the fault of the person that is clicking on them as these elements are specifically designed to appear safe.\nWe’ve all seen these emails. They contain a non-assuming subject like “work from home” or “cheap pharmaceuticals” and don’t look like anything malicious. These sites usually contain a link that will download a file that starts all of the issues. These issues can range from the simple things like adware all the way to the really nasty issues like key loggers and replication viruses. We won’t go into what these specific threats actually do but suffice to say that one threat usually leads to another, and you really don’t want to have to deal with any of them.\nAs hackers become more sophisticated viruses have really become less of an issue, but malware issues have steadily increased. This is largely due to the fact that evasion techniques used by hackers have gotten better over time. This basically means that some viruses and malware are specifically created to be undetectable by current anti virus and anti-malware software.\nNo matter how good your software is, if you click on something that contains a virus or malware there is a much greater chance of infection. Sometimes we as people will fall for an especially creative trick like a window that pops up saying that we have a virus and we just need to “click here” and they will scan for you. This is usually accompanied by a download that appears to scan your computer but will in fact install a virus to your hard drive. These are normally self-explanative. but some people don’t know what to look for.\nMicrosoft and other companies do their best to keep us safe from security exploits in our software like Windows and Office, but while these exploits will be fixed, they still don’t remove the actual virus files. Fixing these exploits reduces the threat of the virus on your computer however. It can close off a feature that may share your personal information or can also fix components damaged by viruses. The importance of updating your operating system and other software cannot be stressed enough. These updates play a large part in keeping the information used on a personal level and a business level safe.\nIn conclusion, it is very important to keep your software up to date for the safety of the information in your system. Viruses and malware can create big issues in the performance of your computer. Now, it is also important to remember that just because your computer is performing poorly does not mean that you have a virus.\nFragmented hard drives can be a big issue that can cause your computer to slow down. This is fixed by running a simple defrag which is a program included in your windows software. If this doesn’t fix the issue, then other fixes must be pursued. Age becomes an issue for many computers. The average life expectancy for a computer for the average person is three to five years before major upgrades must be completed.\nThere are always exceptions to the rule, but the person that uses their computer for advanced tasks will find that their systems seem to perform poorly after that time. Many businesses can pull a little more life out of their systems, but it is important to determine when your computer starts to cost you money instead of making you money and replace those machines.\nIs your computer costing you more in time and repairs than what a new computer can potentially make you? Then take your time back and replace those aging systems.\n** On a side note we used the term \"hacker\" in this blog. Not all hackers are bad. As a matter of fact, a good number of IT professionals began their journey in to technology as a \"hacker.\" Bad hackers that write viruses and break into systems and steal info are also refered to as \"crackers.\" Good \"hackers\" are the superheroes of todays IT world.

{"text": "Security researchers are keeping a wary eye on malicious programs circulating on the Internet designed to carry out invasive tasks in a computer 's random access memory, then disappear without a trace.\n\"We are seeing very sophisticated code that resides in the RAM of a computer that traditional (defensive) software has no chance of detecting,\" says Bob Gourley, chief tech officer of tech consultancy CTOvision.com.\nIn the past year, 10% of malicious code isolated by security firm Triumfant operated exclusively in RAM. That's worrisome, as the current approach to defending networks is built around detecting and disabling malicious programs after a hacker embeds them on the hard drives.\nTriumfant CEO John Prisco refers to RAM-based attacks as \"advanced volatile threats.\" Such attacks require high expertise to pull off, and so far have been comparatively rare. But they could get more usage by elite hacking groups as organizations get better at defending traditional attacks, security researchers say.\n\"What we're seeing more often these days is attackers compromising a user's laptop without having to install any software,\" says Carl Livitt, a researcher at security consultancy Stach & Liu. \"Once the payload is deployed, it can bury itself in RAM, hide from users, hide from anti-virus, hide from system administrators, and act as a staging point from which other attacks can be launched.\"\nThe emergence of AVTs comes as corporations and government agencies are starting to publicly acknowledge network intrusions.\n\"Cybercriminals are always looking for new ways to attack,\" says Pravin Kothari, CEO of encryption firm CipherCloud. \"Organizations need to be proactive in identifying these new threats and correspondingly adopt new technologies to protect their sensitive information.\"\nBut even as companies and governments are starting to collaborate on defenses, the brightest of bad guys have begun honing the next generation of even more insidious attacks.\nIn one caper, documented by Kaspersky Lab, hackers corrupted advertisements appearing on two popular Russian news sites. Anyone using a Windows PC to visit either of the sites got an infection that activated only in RAM. The malicious program got wiped out when the browser shut down. But in the hours the browser was enabled, the infection remained active.\nA subsequent security update now prevents a repeat of that attack.\nEven so, security experts are concerned.\n\"It's worrisome because if there is no way to detect these things as the infection is occurring, the question then becomes, 'What else are they going to do next?'\" says A.N.

It is vital that organizations understand that information and records are assets of the organization, not the individual employee, and as such need to be managed actively and properly. The incorporation of Electronic Records Management Systems (ERMS) and practices provide structure, consistency, security, and control over these records.\nDocument Nation’s web-based ERM system allows for an enterprise-wide classification scheme, allowing you to establish and manage the following:\n- Retention and disposition rules\n- Security and access controls\n- Digital rights management\n- Information sharing", "label": 1}
{"text": "Inside Fibre Channel Switching\nFibre Channel switches form the backbone for storage-area networks, but how does Fibre Channel compare to ATM and Gigabit Ethernet?\nIT managers, once occupied with streamlining and cost-cutting measures, have turned their attention to managing the flood of information that`s critical to their organizations` bottom lines. Enterprise storage--a consolidated storage system that supports heterogeneous operating systems such as Unix and Windows NT--is one solution to the information explosion. Rather than placing information in geographically dispersed departmental servers and storage systems, IT managers can consolidate it and manage it from a central location.\nSuch consolidation places heavy pressure on enterprise interconnect technology. On the upside, open-systems technologies and multi-platform solutions give IT managers a wider choice of vendors and applications from which to choose, increasing protocol and architecture options and improving the overall cost efficiency of enterprise solutions. On the downside, they create a much more complicated IT infrastructure.\nWhile other technologies (e.g., ATM and Gigabit Ethernet) have their strengths, Fibre Channel is the superior connectivity technology for server/storage backbones. Not only is Fibre Channel appropriate for open-systems environments, but it delivers mainframe-class connectivity, data availability, and manageability.\nThe increased connectivity of Fibre Channel switching improves information access. Fibre Channel is an ANSI standard that is protocol-independent. It supports a heterogeneous mix of servers, workstations, and storage devices. It also allows for flexible and scalable networks and has great distance capabilities--and it has the bandwidth and data integrity of channel technologies.\nA Fibre Channel network eliminates the traditional point-to-point connection between a host and storage devices. Instead, any server can access any storage device or any server in the Fibre Channel fabric. Storage systems can be logically consolidated; they don`t have to be located next to each other and they don`t have to occupy expensive data-center floor space. Users gain access to new levels of information from all areas of the organization.\nIn multi-point configurations, storage and servers can be mirrored. If a device fails or needs to be reconfigured, administrators can assign another device on the network to take over, and business continues without interruption. Administrators can take servers off-line for maintenance, while ensuring complete storage availability to all users.\nWith Fibre Channel switching, multiple servers are interconnected to multiple storage devices, giving users complete access to centrally managed data. As servers and I/O subsystems are added, Fibre Channel is able to balance access to the data.\nIn a data center, path redundancy greatly affects data availability and reliability. Unlike traditional SCSI implementations that require one or more physically separate SCSI buses for each host system, a Fibre Channel switch provides a reliable network that simultaneously supports access to multiple SCSI buses.\nThe transfer latency of server-to-storage messaging can also be a key factor in server/storage backbone performance. With total message latency measured in tens of microseconds, the interconnect fabric must provide consistently low frame latency. Frame latency, defined here as the length of time it takes for the first bit of the frame to enter and then exit the switch, can be as low as one microsecond in a Fibre Channel switch.\n\"Connectionless\" Fibre Channel allows concurrent multiplexing of many simultaneous SCSI and IP transfers onto a single link. By using connectionless frame switching in combination with high aggregate bandwidth and credit-based control flow, switched Fibre Channel fabrics avoid dropping frames due to high access contention.\nEnterprise data centers require reliability and data integrity characteristics that meet 24x7 expectations. Fibre Channel offers a highly reliable, built-in protocol with embedded cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which, when combined with such high-availability features as component redundancy and on-line replacement, meets IT managers` expectations for an efficient, highly reliable enterprise fabric. All of these attributes contribute to exceptional data integrity.\nA Fibre Channel fabric provides key management services: device and address discovery, partitioning and security, and performance and error monitoring. Fibre Channel switches provide standards-based management services that assist in device and address configuration, including\n-An embedded ARP server that provides IP address resolution.\n-A name service that allows the server to query the fabric for a list of SCSI targets on the fabric.\n-A notification service that automatically notifies nodes when the fabric topology changes.\n-Embedded SNMP master agents that enable configuration management and monitoring.\nAn extraordinary amount of mission-critical traffic flows through enterprise networks. The Fibre Channel standard gives manufacturers the option of providing administrators with critical network monitoring tools to determine \"hot spots\" and unusual traffic patterns. Equipped with these tools, administrators should be able to quickly detect and isolate paths or nodes that cause high error ratios. Fibre Channel switches can provide a rich set of management objects for monitoring at the path, link, and frame level and for allowing standard management tools to capture information via SNMP or Web-based interfaces.\nFor high-availability systems, switch manufacturers can provide advanced component failure detection and reporting. If a failure occurs within the switch or in the fabric, the nature and location of the problem are reported immediately, avoiding expensive delays. Some Fibre Channel switches also have management capabilities that make the systems easier to use and ultimately help ensure data availability. For example, the switched fabric could be managed through a locally attached console or over the Internet through a remote console. Status monitoring, user-configurable failover criteria, and nondisruptive service should also be functions of the management software.\nOptions and Tradeoffs\nFibre Channel offers a range of scaling options, which trade price for performance. For example, by installing a base configuration of a partially populated switch, ports can be added without disruption while keeping initial costs low. It is important to remember that each additional port on a switch adds--not subtracts--interconnect bandwidth.\nAnother option is cascading, or connecting multiple switches using one or more switch ports. This configuration is particularly useful in disaster recovery applications where the geographic separation of system elements is important. Switch cascading does affect total system performance since ports have to be dedicated to interconnect switches. And to some extent, throughput performance is affected by heavy traffic through the interconnecting ports.\nTo maximize performance, the best choice is often a nonblocking switch with a large port count. This type of switch provides maximum throughput and bandwidth in a large, diversified environment. In a cost-sensitive or lower-performance environment, a switch that supports a Fibre Channel loop topology allows the cost of each switch port to be amortized over the many connections on the loop.\nData center fabrics also need to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the enterprise network. Using cascading and the virtually unlimited address space capabilities of Fibre Channel switches (in combination with fabric management tools), administrators can easily connect distributed work groups and departments to the data center. This centralizes backup and allows for high-capacity on-line storage throughout the enterprise, while lowering administration costs and providing economies of scale.\nFibre Channel vs. ATM and Gigabit Ethernet\nFibre Channel. Fibre Channel has roots in networking and highly reliable mainframe environments. As mainframe manufacturers continue to look for ways to drive down costs and as open-systems vendors move to more scalable and reliable environments, Fibre Channel represents the best possible server-storage interconnect technology.\nAnother benefit of Fibre Channel is its ability to carry TCP/IP or specialized server protocols. This allows users to piggyback server-to-server traffic over the storage network for environments where server-to-server traffic must be isolated from the client/server network. Specialized industries, such as the video and post-production communities, have endorsed Fibre Channel as the connectivity solution of choice and have defined techniques to migrate their high-performance applications to Fibre Channel.\nIn most cases, Fibre Channel is best for high-speed links to storage systems, server-to-server interconnects, real-time backup, and massive data retrieval. It is not the best technology for connections to the desktop or for wide-area networks (WANs) over extended distances.\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Fibre Channel is not the only TCP/IP carrier. Standards define integration of ATM with existing TCP/IP LANs. However, ATM requires a substantial investment in new equipment, tools, and protocol knowledge for forward migration of campus client/server networks.\nTelecommunications standards provide mappings for ATM onto WAN carrier technologies as well as inter-switching communication protocols. Support by the telecommunications industry is helping the deployment of ATM in the global enterprise networking market.\nIn most cases, ATM is best for telecommunications applications, global networks over WANs, and delivery of real-time and multimedia traffic. It is not the best technology for transports that can`t tolerate information loss, storage-area networks (SANs), or simple forward migration of client/server networks.\nGigabit Ethernet. Although Ethernet protocols are used predominately for TCP/IP client/server networks, they also support other protocols such as IPX and DECnet. In many networks today, switched Ethernet networks with Fast Ethernet backbones are connecting switches or are attached as up-links to servers. The natural extension is switched Fast Ethernet networks with Gigabit Ethernet backbones.\nGigabit Ethernet can connect to Ethernet and Fast Ethernet via a simple low-cost bridge. This allows IT departments to protect their investment in drivers. Existing Ethernet systems also provide a minimal learning curve for system administrators. This makes Gigabit Ethernet a popular technology for client/server environments. Gigabit Ethernet adds performance to existing networks and can be integrated with lower-speed Ethernet infrastructures.\nIn most cases, Gigabit Ethernet is best for client/server networking to support higher bandwidth backbones for Fast Ethernet switches and for aggregating traffic in TCP/IP networks. It is not the best technology for bulk traffic or block-oriented traffic typical of channel/storage attachments, highly reliable backbones that cannot tolerate frame loss, and latency-sensitive traffic.\nEach technology has individual strengths and best uses. ATM will remain the technology of choice for WANs, with some penetration in campus and multimedia delivery networks. Gigabit Ethernet will dominate PC LAN backbones and eventually extend to desktops in the high-performance market. Fibre Channel will dominate server/storage backbones and extend into departments and work groups, creating a distributed network for storage applications.\nThe data center environment includes an increasingly wide variety of server and storage platforms. In these complex environments, it is increasingly important to provide interconnect flexibility and scalability as well as a wide range of price/performance options. The right solution should provide the benefits of the open-systems environment while meeting mainframe-class requirements for enterprise-wide applications and interconnection to existing loop installations. Fibre Channel switching provides these benefits for enterprise storage. Large Fibre Channel switches with high-availability characteristics can be the best fit for these environments because they provide the necessary aggregate bandwidth, balance access contention, and offer predictable latency, high reliability, enterprise-class manageability, and the interconnection flexibility needed to meet IT requirements for mission-critical applications.\nA 16-port Fibre Channel switch provides an aggregate (flow-through) bandwidth of 1.6GBps.\nHow Does Fibre Channel Switching Work?\nFibre Channel`s greatest potential lies in fabric switching. A switch is a multi-port device; each port manages a simple point-to-point connection to attached devices. The interconnect provides concurrent any-to-any connectivity between devices.\nFrom a physical perspective, the topology of a Fibre Channel switch is identical to that of a hub. Both are wired in a star configuration, enabling you to add or remove devices with minimal disruption. However, hubs share bandwidth between devices and have a 1Gbps total (aggregate) bandwidth. A switch port can be attached to a server, peripheral, I/O subsystem, bridge, hub, router, or even another switch. Any port can transmit or receive data at any given time at the full 1Gbps rate. Much like a phone system, the calling device dials the equivalent of a phone number for the destination device and the switch automatically establishes a connection. Multiple calls or data transfers happen concurrently through a multi-port Fibre Channel switch.\nIn a gigabit-per-second Fibre-Channel-switched network, or multi-point \"fabric,\" storage can be networked and available to multiple host systems, servers, and workstations that use IP, SCSI, or other protocols. Fibre Channel provides highly reliable serial transmission interconnects, replacing bulky cabling and distance-limiting parallel transmission technologies such as SCSI. Fibre Channel also supports an end-to-end bit-error ratio of one error in every 1,012 bits transferred, using 8b/10b encoding, embedded cyclic redundancy check (CRC), and robust bit-error checking algorithms.\nPeter Dougherty is director of Fibre Channel product marketing at McData Corp., in Broomfield, CO.

{"text": "Due to the varying nature and origin of computer viruses, preventing an infection is just as much a matter of being mindful of what you click on, as it is of having software to help you to respond to any threats. Since Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware programs are always updating their software to respond to threats that have been reported, the latest malicious software tends to be one step ahead. As a result, your first line of prevention is to be aware of what you’re doing and whether your actions are about to open up the possibility of any infection.\nWhether it’s a video player pop-up message saying, “install this new component to view your video” or whether you’re opening a link or email attachment sent from a seemingly legitimate source, taking a moment to evaluate whether you really trust the content can help you prevent an infection. However, if an infection does manage to embed itself into a legitimate file or copy to your system without any need of your actual interaction, your software then comes into play.\nA distinction, though sometimes unclear, exists between Malware and Viruses. As a result, it’s often difficult to find a single prevention software solution that will tackle both malicious acts effectively. You’ll commonly need both dedicated Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware products. Each of these programs will act in similar fashions; ensuring they’re both configured and running properly is important.\nMake sure your definitions are up-to-date.\nThis can be done by checking the update settings to ensure the program is set to automatically update, and if necessary, paying to renew any licenses with the software vendor to ensure you can keep receiving updates. Both preventing and responding to malicious infections effectively is dependent on whether the protection software is up to date.\nRun full scans of your system regularly, preferably a few times a month.\nThis can either be done in the software by configuring a weekly scan of your hard drives or by manually remembering to leave a scan running, possibly overnight when you’re done with the PC for the day. This will ensure that no infections have snuck onto the system, probably waiting to be activated.\nReal-time protection is an important feature to prevent many infections.\nReal-time protection acts by scanning every object as you run it, whether that means scanning a document when you open it, or scanning a link when you click it. Since the program needs to check the data before opening it, this may cause a slowdown in performance as it acts as an important barrier between the line of preventing or responding to an infection.\nBecome fully secure with the latest computer software for virus and malware protection today! Still unsure what to get? Ask us; we are computer experts!\nAnd check out our blog article, Which is the best computer protection software?\nA computer virus is a common phrase used to describe any type of malicious software designed to replicate and spread to multiple computer systems. The methods viruses use to replicate are dependent upon the person writing the virus software. Often the person coding a virus starts with picking a security flaw to exploit. Types of security flaws can vary, allowing for different forms of viruses and methods of attack, such as:\n- email systems allowing types of infected attachments to be delivered to a mailbox\n- a website’s application or database engine allowing code to become inserted and infecting a legitimate webpage\n- messages and emails containing no program, but are designed to appear to be from a legitimate source yet directing the user to an illegitimate or infected destination\nRegardless, sometimes there are people who are simply searching for security flaws to report them, so they may be fixed or sell the information to people who will exploit the flaw.\nChronology of a Computer Virus\n1. Once the security flaw is chosen and a small “virus” is written to exploit it, the means of attack will be chosen to send the virus out. Often it’s done using a “botnet” network of PCs controlled remotely to automatically perform the task that may have already been infected by another virus to perform this task.\n2. From here they will be setup to perform tasks like an “injection” to insert the malicious code into a legitimate website, creating a “drive-by download” where the malicious code is downloaded without any user interaction, or send out a massive number of infected or fraudulent “phishing” emails designed to trick the user.\nNote: Often the first virus which infects a computer is designed to perform no action, but rather is designed to get “a foot in the door” for further infections. As a result of this need to not be detected, these initial viruses are constantly changing to keep a step ahead of the Anti-Virus software.\nOnce infected however, these viruses may be designed to perform tasks automatically to further infect the system, such as:\n- responding to commands remotely\n- adding it to the “botnet”\n- installing malicious programs designed to bombard the user ads for fraudulent “scareware” products like a fake Anti-Virus or Malware\n- “keylogging” all typed keystrokes, looking for patterns like credit card numbers or passwords\nOften enough, each step of this is segregated. An underground economic model starts to emerge where specific roles develop to keep up in the constant world of technology.\nHow Computer Viruses Spread\n1. People find vulnerabilities and sell the information to programmers\n2. Those who write code for exploitation sell it to people who control botnets of thousands of computer systems\n3. Those botnet controllers will then use their botnets to infect more systems in order to install malicious or fraudulent software which they’ve been paid to do\n4. Finally, the malicious software which users may see might be designed to trick the user into paying $50 for fraudulent software or steal financial information. By this point, an economic model emerges, where the FBI has estimated $150 million dollars have been spent in fake Anti-Virus scams alone.\nNeed Anti-Virus software to protect your computer? Ask us today!\nIf Malware is preventing you from getting on the internet, usually it’s caused by a bogus “proxy server” that’s been setup to hijack your internet browsing activity. You could contact a computer consultant, or try fixing the issue yourself….\n1. Get in via Safe Mode.\nTo do this, hit the F8 key when you startup your PC and the select to boot into “Safe Mode with Networking”. The “With Networking” part will be important to troubleshooting when you can get online again and to download some tools once you’re in Safe Mode.\nOnce Microsoft Windows loads, it will alert you that you are running Windows in Safe mode and click “OK” to continue.\n2. Open Internet Explorer.\nSelect “Tools” then “Internet Options.” Click the “Connections” tab. On this “Connections” tab click the “LAN Settings” button.\nHere is where the “Proxy server” settings are. Uncheck any checkboxes for Proxy Servers. Then hit “OK” on this Window and finally hit “OK” on the Internet Options window.\nIf a proxy server was at fault, you should now be able to get online for the time being. However, I’d recommend you stay in Safe Mode, and use this oppertunity to download, install, and run a legitimate Antivirus, and more importantly an “Anti-Malware” program. If you don’t have one already, I’d recommend AVG Free, and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. A virus may have allowed the Malware to get installed, but running an Anti-Malware program like Malwarebytes is the most important at this point, because Malware is what’s popping up and preventing you from getting online.\nNo time to stop by your office before your next appointment? There’s a bookstore with free Wi-Fi right down the street…But how safe is the bookstore computer network? Tons of other unknown users are connected…Could the innocent-looking, coffee-drinking dude at the next table be sending a virus through the free Wi-Fi network as we speak? How safe is free Wi-Fi? How can you stay secure on an unsecure network?\nWhen connecting to a free Wi-Fi hotspot…\n- The security of your connection depends upon how it was setup by the provider. The free Wi-Fi could be setup with wireless encryption and settings to keep users segregated from each other, which may require you to take some steps to obtain a username & password from the provider. It could also be completely open with no encryption or security measures to make it as easy as possible for you to connect…and anyone else.\n- It’s best to err on the side of caution and assume that anything you will be doing can be logged, accessed or intercepted. Malicious individuals can simply hop onto the wireless traffic, run programs that will “sniff out” the computer network and eventually crack the wireless encryption, allowing them to see what other users are accessing. Avoiding activity such as credit card transactions, accessing bank accounts or any other sensitive actions should be avoided. Viruses and other attacks can also spread through networks. This is why you want to ensure you have up-to-date Antivirus and a Firewall, which helps prevent access to your system.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Can't remember all your passwords? Try these tricks\nThere is no perfect way to make passwords both convenient and safe, but there are some tricks and techniques that can help.\nA recent column on the relative security of complex passwords and simpler — but possibly safer — pass phrases caught the attention of a number of readers. Apparently, quite a few people struggle with the challenge of keeping their portfolio of passwords secure and manageable at the same time.\nThe problem with passwords is that managing secure ones becomes difficult when you have more than one or two, and most people have many more than that.\nA typical complex password runs to eight characters and contains letters, numerals and special characters. A pass phrase, as the word implies, is much longer. But because the phrase can mean something to the user, it can be easier to remember, and its length can make it strong without arbitrary characters. Mushegh Hakhinian, security architect at IntraLinks, pointed out in a recent blog posting that a pass phrase that contains 16 letters — all lower case with no numerals or special characters — can provide in the neighborhood of 10 million more possible combinations than an eight-character complex password that uses upper and lower case, numerals and other characters.\nOne reader agreed with the math but not necessarily the conclusion.\n“While there is a 26-character set in our alphabet, the fact is that most words only use a subset of those characters and follow predictable patterns (how many all-consonant words can you think of?),” he wrote. “I think longer pass phrases are useful and easier to remember, but I don’t think we’ll be getting rid of mixed case and special characters by making longer pass phrases.”\nDave Simpson, technology director for the Frederick County, Md., Sheriff’s Office, offered a pattern-based technique to keep passwords pseudo-random yet memorable — starting with a letter and then adding letters according to a pattern on the keyboard.\n“Then you only need to remember one letter: the beginning letter,” he wrote. “The secure part is the pattern you choose on the keyboard.” If you have a QWERTY keyboard in front of you, you can refer to it to see the patterns he suggests. “You could go ‘asdfghjk’ (too easy). Or you could go ‘qazwsxed’ (harder). Or you could go ‘qpwoeiru’ (still harder).”\nUnfortunately, I imagine that such patterns probably have been anticipated and that password-cracking programs know to search for them. Still, the resulting passwords are probably at least as secure as the average passwords most of us use and can be easily changed.\nAnother writer pointed out that sentences used as pass phrases can contain quotation marks, numerals and other characters, making them even more secure than the average password while remaining memorable. “I have tried to crack pass phrases such as this but gave up after a month,” he wrote.\nIf you are of a linguistic or literary bent, you can take this technique to the extreme. “If your system, as mine does, accepts foreign characters, you can mix in a quote in Hebrew characters among the English, French, Spanish, German,” he wrote. “My PGP pass phrase is an original poem of mine — never written down any place — in German. Easy for me to remember since I wrote it. I will publish it when I change pass phrases.”\nWe’ll be waiting for it.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Research & Commentary: Internet Privacy and Do Not Track Legislation\nInternet privacy has become a hot issue as technology to track user movements online has become more widespread. Much of the debate centers on “behavioral advertising,” through which businesses target their marketing based on Web users’ search and browsing histories.\nSome critics of the practice argue tracking Internet users’ online activities is an invasion of privacy. They have pushed for laws and regulations limiting how and when companies can track online movements. Both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and U.S. Congress have proposed new regulations creating a “do not track” policy in which Internet browsers and Web sites will be forbidden to track online movements without explicit permission.\nSome legislation addressing online privacy and do not track already has been introduced. The Do Not Track Me Online Act, proposed by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) would give the FTC the authority to force online marketers to give consumers the choice to be tracked online and to disclose how they collect and share their data and with whom they share it. The Do-Not-Track Online Act of Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV) is similar. The Do Not Track Kids Act, proposed by Reps. Edward Markey (D-MA) and Joe Barton (R-TX), would prohibit Internet companies from sending targeted advertising to children and from collecting personal and location information without parents’ consent. Both these bills are currently stalled in Congress.\nSuch regulations are already obsolete. Companies are integrating such privacy measures without government intervention. Currently, the most recent versions of the three major browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome), making up 81 percent of Web use, include do-not-track features.\nJohn Stephenson, director of the Communications and Technology Task Force at the American Legislative Exchange Council, argues further government intrusion is unnecessary and harmful. “Some argue for new, invasive laws and government mandates to protect our privacy. But why not use the consumer protection laws and sophisticated technologies currently at our disposal to exercise our freedom to protect our privacy?” asked Stephenson.\nOverregulating behavioral advertising could suppress the growing Internet economy. Behavioral advertising is responsible for keeping most of the Internet services consumers take for granted free of charge. Regulating advertisers and limiting the techniques they can use would cause imposition of fees for currently free services such as Web-based email, social networking, and news. In addition, a ban on tracking will make it more difficult for small businesses to afford Internet advertising.\nThe following articles examine behavioral advertising, Internet privacy, and do not track proposals from multiple perspectives.\nTen Principles of Telecom Policy\nHance Haney and George Gilder examine in this Heartland Institute Legislative Principles booklet the beneficial results of telecom reforms in Indiana, the advances made by other innovative leaders in the telecom market, and how other states can follow their lead to reap the rewards of new investment in telecommunications services.\nOnline ‘Do Not Track’ Bill Introduced in House\nChloe Albanesius of PC Magazine examines the Do Not Track Me Online Act, its origins, and its sponsor’s goals for improving Internet privacy.\nFTC Prompts Congress to Enact Online Privacy Regulations\nThe Heartlander digital magazine reports on the FTC’s proposals for online privacy regulations, quoting both opponents and supporters of do not track regulations.\n‘Do Not Track’ Legislation Is On the Move\nMark Hachman discusses in PC Magazine the various bills being considered to regulate Internet privacy and impose do not track regulation, quoting several experts supporting the bills.\n5 Reasons Why the Federal Trade Commission’s Proposed Online Privacy Rules Will Do More Harm Than Good\nSteven Titch, a policy analyst at Reason Foundation, argues self-regulation, consumer choice, and market models are the best tools for protecting online consumer privacy, and he concludes the proposed rules from the FTC are likely to do more harm then good.\nTo Track or ‘Do Not Track’: Advancing Transparency and Individual Control in Online Behavioral Advertising\nOmer Tene and Jules Polonetsky argue any proposals to regulate use of Internet data should be informed by an understanding of the fundamental tradeoff between privacy and economic efficiency.

Once you hash it, you can never recover the password yourself. There's no way to ever recover the password. But, you can still check if the user has entered the correct password by repeating the hash on what they typed in, and see if it matches the one stored in the database.\nIf hackers steal your password hashes, they can crack them offline.\nThe most common crack is to pre-calculate a zillion password hashes. When they steal hashes from your site, they look them up in a table, and instantly find the original password.\nTo defeat that, you \"salt\" the password. You generate some random text, and hash that text with the password. You then store that salt+hash in your database.\nThis forces the hackers to \"brute-force\" your passwords instead of using a \"table lookup\". Hacker desktops can calculate 1-billion hashes per second, so they will quickly discover small passwords.\nTo defeat that, you simply repeatedly hash the value. If you repeat the hash a thousand times, the hacker can now only test a million per second.\nUnfortunately, the more expensive you make it for the hacker, the more expensive you make testing passwords for yourself. Repeating the hash a 1000 times is a good compromise between slowing down the hacker and impacting the performance of your server.\nAnother way of slowing down the hacker are applying rules to passwords, such as demanding that they be at least 8 characters long and containing numbers and symbols. Most passwords are words, in all lower case letters. That means the hacker needs only test 26 combinations per letter. If passwords are composed of upper and lower case, numbers, and symbols, that becomes around 100 combinations per letter.\nThe point of the above is to teach you all the complications of how hackers attacks passwords, and the things administrators go through in order to defend those passwords. Usually, you don't need to worry about it: you just choose the solution the underlying system you are using has chosen for you.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Now, AVG has found evidence that pre-teens are writing malware designed to steal login details from online gamers, both young and old.\nWhile stealing someone’s game logins may at first seem a minor problem, online gaming accounts are often connected to credit card details to enable in-game purchases, and may also have virtual currency attached to them amounting to hundreds of dollars.\nFurthermore, many gamers unfortunately use the same login details for social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, potentially putting the victim at risk of cyber-bullying, in addition to identity theft and major inconvenience.\n“We have now seen a number of examples of very young individuals writing malware, including an 11-year-old from Canada,” said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, CTO at AVG Technologies. “The code usually takes the form of a basic Trojan written using the .NET framework, which is easy to learn for beginners and simple to deploy via a link in an email or posted on a social media page.”\n“We believe these junior programmers are motivated mainly by the thrill of outwitting their peers, rather than financial gain, but it is nevertheless a disturbing and increasing trend. It is also logical to assume that at least some of those responsible will be tempted to experiment with much more serious cyber-crimes.” (Find more information on page 19 of the report).\nThe Q4 Threat Report also highlights the dramatic and ongoing increase in mobile malware, particularly of code designed to target Google’s hugely popular Android operating system.\nDuring the course of 2012, AVG Threat Labs reported on the First Android Rootkit, examples of mobile banking being targeted for attack, malicious apps that send text messages to premium rate services, and Trojan-infected versions of popular games on unofficial app stores, including bestseller Angry Birds Space.\nMobile threats also feature in the Threat Report’s predictions for 2013, notably in the form of increased MITMO (Man-In-The-Mobile) attacks that target PC and mobile internet banking apps. Such threats might benefit from the growing BYOD trend, where workers connect their personal mobile devices to company networks.\nAlongside the rise in mobile malware, the Threat Labs found exploit toolkits continue to dominate when it comes to online threats. Almost 60 per cent of all threat activity online was performed by exploit toolkits in 2012.\nThe use of such kits is believed to be the result of established cyber-criminals realizing that they can create and sell commercial toolkits at a premium to less technically savvy peers eager to get into the market.\nOne example of a new exploit toolkit which emerged during the last quarter of 2012, and bore a remarkable resemblance to the Blackhole Exploit Kit, was the Cool Toolkit. This new toolkit accounted for 16 per cent of the top web threats in Q4 2012, topped only by Blackhole at 40 per cent.\nBy subscribing to our early morning news update, you will receive a daily digest of the latest security news published on Help Net Security.\nWith over 500 issues so far, reading our newsletter every Monday morning will keep you up-to-date with security risks out there.", "label": 1}

Not only will this help them in the future, but it will protect your valuable computer!\nThe next area of concern is cyber bullying. Social networks have quickly become a place where kids may be teased or bullied. Teach your children to never share their passwords with anyone, even their best friends. You should also make a rule that they always log out of any account (social media, email, etc.) as soon as they are done using it. This prevents anyone from finding the account and posting something inappropriate under their name.\nIf a child is being cyber bullied, have them keep good records by taking screenshots of any messages. Then report this information to the school and the website. Any threats should also be reported to the police.\nAnd finally, you want to teach your children about protecting their online reputation. It can be hard for a child or adolescent to understand the consequences of inappropriate behavior over the long term.

{"text": "(Phys.org) -- A surveillance device that uses WiFi radio waves has been devised to see through walls to detect, in military and surveillance parlance, moving personnel targets. The device serves as a radar prototype designed by two UK scientists at the University College London (UCL). The scientists devised the radar prototype as a way to track Wi-Fi signals in order to spy through walls. Their device identifies frequency changes to detect the moving objects. An important feature of their work is that since the device itself does not emit radio waves, it cannot be detected; it operates in stealth.\nKarl Woodbridge and Kevin Chetty, researchers at University College London, designed their detector to be able to use these signals. Chetty is a lecturer in the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London; Woodbridge is with the schools Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering. The two demonstrate what is called a passive radar system that can see through walls using WiFi signals generated by wireless routers and access points. Passive radar systems detect and track objects by processing reflections from non-cooperative sources of illumination in the environment, such as commercial broadcast and communications signals.\nThe scientists paper, Through-the-Wall Sensing of Personnel Using Passive Bistatic WiFi Radar at Standoff Distances\" coauthored with G.E. Smith, appeared in the April issue of Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions.\nThe prototype is about the size of a suitcase and it carries two antennae and signal processing unit, to monitor baseline WiFi frequency in an area for any change that would indicate movement. The device in tests successfully determined a persons location, speed and direction through a brick wall that was one-foot-thick.\nSee Through The Wall (STTW) technologies are of great interest to law enforcement and military agencies; this particular device has the UK Military of Defense exploring whether it might be used in urban warfare, for scanning buildings. Other more benign applications might range from monitoring children to monitoring the elderly.\nAccording to Woodbridge, some challenges remain which he and others involved in the research will attempt to resolve. The UCL team hopes to raise system sensitivity so that their system can pick up and detect not only people who are moving but also people who are standing or sitting still. The device, he said, may be made to be sensitive enough to pick up on subtle motions that the ribcage makes in breathing in and out.\nWi-Fi radio signals are found in homes worldwide. Strategy Analytics, a market intelligence company, found in its recent study that 439 million households by the end of 2011 worldwide had WiFi network setups, or about 25 percent of all households. The same report predicts that the worldwide number of Wi-Fi households will reach nearly 800 million in 2016, a penetration rate of 42 percent.\nExplore further: Broadcom enters 5G pearly gates with new chip BCM4335\nMore information: Through-the-Wall Sensing of Personnel Using Passive Bistatic WiFi Radar at Standoff Distances, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 50, issue 4, pp. 1218-1226, DOI:10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164411\nIn this paper, we investigate the feasibility of uncooperatively and covertly detecting people moving behind walls using passive bistatic WiFi radar at standoff distances. A series of experiments was conducted which involved personnel targets moving inside a building within the coverage area of a WiFi access point. These targets were monitored from outside the building using a 2.4-GHz passive multistatic receiver, and the data were processed offline to yield range and Doppler information. The results presented show the first through-the-wall (TTW) detections of moving personnel using passive WiFi radar. The measured Doppler shifts agree with those predicted by bistatic theory. Further analysis of the data revealed that the system is limited by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and not the signal-to-noise ratio. We have also shown that a new interference suppression technique based on the CLEAN algorithm can improve the SIR by approximately 19 dB. These encouraging initial findings demonstrate the potential for using passive WiFi radar as a low-cost TTW detection sensor with widespread applicability.\nvia Popsci, Extremetech", "label": 1}

Although it started out as a metaphor for the internet, the “Cloud“ has since been re-defined and everyone seems to have a different definition of what it is.\nAt Cloud People we like to think of cloud computing as a technology set that delivers a broad range of IT services over the internet. Instead of having to purchase, install and manage your own IT infrastructure locally, these services are provided over the internet. This is very different from a traditional on-premise IT model and represents a paradigm shift in the way IT services are consumed and managed. These IT services can range from email and simple web-based applications, to completely hosted private cloud data centres.\nCloud computing utilises remote servers housed in secure data centres. By not locating servers on-premise, businesses can leverage cloud computing to obtain equivalent services via the internet from cloud hosting providers.\nCloud Hosting Characteristics\nScalability & Elasticity\nCloud services can scale up or down to meet the changing needs of businesses\nCustomers have the ability to easily add IT services themselves through web-based portals\nIndividual infrastructure components are duplicated and failover between each other to maintain service\nUtility style billing\nCustomers are charged by the hour, day or month for exactly what they use\nThe underlying computing infrastructure serves the needs of multiple customers\nCloud services are delivered over the internet\nCloud Building Blocks\nSoftware as a Service\nSaaS delivers software applications through a web browser using multi-tenant architecture.

{"text": "Setting Up Norton Parental Control\nChild safety is a big issue anywhere, but the online world presents special challenges in the form of virtual bogeymen, pitfalls, and the kind of Web sites that can fluster or enrage a mature adult. Parental Control in Norton Internet Security is a way for you to define the boundaries of your kid's online world, choosing which programs your child can run, and the types of accessible Web sites.\nYou have a number of steps to get through in turning on and setting up the Parental Control. Try to follow along in order, because some parts — like the Supervisor login — need to be done before you can do other parts of the setup.\nLogging on as Supervisor\nRight out of the package, Norton Parental Control and Norton Internet Security recognize just one account, called a Supervisor account because it allows the person using it to make master changes to how Internet Security and kid-safe control settings are configured. However, by default, no password is assigned to this account. Find out how to do that after you log in, in the \"Running the Parental Control Wizard\" section.\nYou must be logged in as the Supervisor in order to turn on the Parental Control feature and then create accounts and set up controls for the kids.\nFollow these steps to log in:\n1. Right-click the Norton Internet Security icon in System Tray and choose Account Login.\n2. In the Log On window, click OK.\nYou can also log on directly from Norton Internet Security:\n1. From the Norton Internet Security window, click User Accounts in the left-side menu.\n2. Press the Log On button.\n3. Type your password, and click OK.\nIf you try to use the Parental Control feature without logging on as Supervisor, you'll receive an error message telling you that you don't have sufficient privileges to do that. Unfortunately, the error message doesn't actually suggest you log on to cure that problem, so it's something to keep in mind.\nRunning the Parental Control Wizard\nInitial setup of the Parental Control tool is managed from a wizard helping you with bits of information each step of the way. Be sure you've already logged on as the Supervisor before you start, then follow these steps:\n1. In Norton Internet Security, click User Accounts in the left-hand menu.\n2. Click Parental Control Wizard link from the top right-hand portion of the window.\n3. Select whether to use existing Windows accounts (if your kids have their own separate accounts for use on the PC) or Norton Internet Security Accounts (if you don't have accounts set up under Windows), then click Next.\n4. Type a password to apply to the currently unprotected Supervisor account, then type it again to confirm it, and click Next.\n5. In the Create Accounts window, use the blank boxes to type in the names of the people who will share the same PC, then click in the drop-down list box next to the names to specify whether that person should be treated as a:\n• Child: Has limited access to the Internet but can't change account settings.\n• Teenager: Has access to more content than the child status but can't change his own settings.\n• Adult: Has full access to the Internet and can change settings for his own account but not for anyone else.\n• Supervisor: Has full access to the Internet and the ability to change others' settings and turn Parental Control off and on.\n6. Click OK, then click Next.\n7. When prompted, set a password for each user/account you set up in Step 5 and click Next.\nThese passwords can be the same as passwords used by each person to access Windows on the PC or different ones — if they're different, be sure that each person knows his password for Parental Control.\n8. Select the account that Norton Internet Security should treat as the default account, and click Next.\nNote: Not Logged On or an Adult account is better than a Supervisor account or a Child account for this purpose.\n9. Click Finish.\nPasswords you set in the preceding list are case-sensitive. If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters in setting the password, the person logging in to the account must use the exact same mix.\nTurning on Parental Control\nAfter you've done the setup to use Parental Control, you still need to enable it so it's ready and running ahead of your kids. Remember to log on as a Supervisor for this if you've already logged off.\nTake these steps to enable Parental Control:\n1. In Norton Internet Security, click to open the Norton Internet Security menu at the left side of the screen.\n2. Choose Status & Settings.\n3. Select Parental Control and then click Turn On.\nTweaking your Parental Control settings\nParental Control comes preset to try to keep children out of Web sites with content most parents would find inappropriate. You can also customize settings, however, to make allowances when you need more — or less — flexibility for your kids.\nYou may want to test your accounts and how loose or restrictive the Web access is for Child and Teenager accounts before you make adjustments.\nFollow these steps to view your setting options:\n1. Log on as a Supervisor and open Norton Internet Security.\n2. From the Status & Settings window, click Parental Control, and then press the Configure button.\nThe Parental Control window, opens.\n3. In the Parental Control window:\n• To select the account name you're adjusting settings for, select the Parental Control Settings For drop-down list and choose an account.\n• To block or permit full categories of sites (such as Humor or Sex Education), click Sites and then choose your categories and settings, and click OK.\n• To add specific sites to a blocked or allowed list, follow the steps in the previous bullet but click Add Site, type in the Web address (for example, www.nakeddogs.org) and click OK.\n• To specify which types of software can be used to access the Internet, press the Programs button, and make sure checkmarks appear next to all allowed programs and that all programs you don't want to permit are unchecked, and click OK.\n• To allow or block access to Internet newsgroups, press the Newsgroups button, specify the newsgroups or newsgroup types to show or hide, and click OK.\n• To go back to the default, out-of-the-box settings for Parental Control, which erases all your changes, click the Defaults button and click Yes to confirm your choice.\n4. When you're satisfied with your changes, click OK to close the Parental Control window.\nTesting your accounts\nBefore you give out accounts and passwords to your kids, you want to make sure the accounts work and that, when you use a child or teenager's account, he can't get access to the types of sites you want to keep out of his reach.\nFollow these steps:\n1. Right-click the Norton Internet Security icon in the Windows System Tray and choose Logoff (if logged in) or select Account Login.\n2. Sign in with the first of your child or teenager accounts, and click OK.\nClick the down arrow next to the account name to select a different user than the one listed. When prompted, type the password for that user's Parental Control account.\n3. Open your Web browser (connect to the Internet if you haven't already).\n4. Use a search engine to locate a racy Web site, and then click to open it.\n5. Repeat Step 3 and try a number of other sites.\n6. Jot down any notes about the type of content that gets through.\n7. Run your Internet programs ,such as chat software or messaging, to see how well they continue to work while you're still logged in as a child.\n8. Repeat Steps 1–7 for other Child/Teenager accounts you created.\n9. If necessary, go back and customize the settings for your child or teenager again to increase or decrease the restrictions or to block specific sites and programs.\nAfter you've tested their accounts and made any needed changes for access, you can then supply your kids and other adults with their passwords. Remind them to log in using their own account.", "label": 1}
{"text": "So how did I get infected in the first place?\nYou usually get infected due to one of these issues:\n1. Your security settings are too low.\n2. Your security programs are not regularly updated.\n3. You don't have a full set of security programs installed and running in resident mode.\n4. You visit dangerous sites or open attachments from without checking them first.\nSafe Computing Practices\n1.) Keep your Windows updated!\n- You can either update Windows automatically (recommended) or manually. Each version of Windows has small differences in how to turn on Automatic Updates:\n- Windows XP: Use the Security Center in Control Panel.\nVista: Use Windows Update which can be reached through Start, All Programs.\nWindows 7: Use the Action Center which can be reached through the Control Panel, System and Security.\n- If you wish to do manual updates, there are a number of ways to do it depending on how much time you wish to put into it and which version of Windows you are using. Please refer to the Microsoft Support for details. Be careful to download all critical updates and the latest Service Pack for your version of Windows.\n- If you believe your computer is already infected, it is good idea to wait to install any updates until it is cleaned since they can be corrupted by the infection. Keeping Windows updated is one of the best ways to reduce your chances of getting infected.\n- Many \"freeware\" programs come with an enormous amount of bundled spyware that will slow down your system, spawn pop-up advertisements, or just plain crash your browser or even Windows itself.\n- Peer-to-peer (P2P) programs like Kazaa, BearShare, Imesh, FrostWire, and others are amongst the most notorious.\n- Just look at the number of high profile compromises in the news as a result of P2P software:\n- Note also that even if the P2P software you are using is \"clean\", a large percentage of the files served on the P2P network are likely to be infected. Do not open any files without being certain of what they are!\n- Many disreputable sites will attempt to install malware on your system through \"drive-by\" exploits just by visiting the site in your browser. Lyrics sites, free software sites (especially ones that target young children), cracked software sites, and pornography sites are some of the worst offenders.\n- Most of these drive-by attempts will be thwarted if you keep your Windows updated and your internet browser secured (see below). Nevertheless, it is very important only to visit web sites that are trustworthy and reputable.\n- In addition, never give out personal information of any sort online. And never click \"OK\" to a pop-up unless it is signed by a reputable company and you know what it is!\n- For more general information see the first section, \"Educate yourself and be smart about where you visit and what you click on\", in this tutorial by Grinler of BleepingComputer.\n*NOTE*: Please only run one anti-virus and one anti-spyware program (in resident mode) and one firewall on your system. Running more than one of these at a time can cause system crashes and/or conflicts with each other. Of the following programs, passive protection like SpywareBlaster, IE-SPYAD and MVPS Hosts file can be used with active resident protection programs effectively. The free version of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware is an on-demand scan and clean program that will also not conflict with resident protection, Spybot is also on-demand but has resident protection if the Teatimer function is used. Only one scan at a time should be run.\n*NOTE*: Check to see if the antivirus is already running an anti-spyware component before installing a separate anti-spyware program.\n- An Anti-Virus product is a necessity. There are many excellent programs that you can purchase. However, we choose to advocate the use of free programs whenever possible. Some very good and easy-to-use free antivirus programs are Avast, AntiVir and Microsoft Security Essentials Please run only one antivirus resident at a time!\n- It's a good idea to set your antivirus to receive automatic updates so you are always as fully protected as possible from the newest threats.\n- Many malware infections install themselves by exploiting security holes in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It is strongly suggested that you consider using an alternate browser.\n- Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Opera are next-generation browsers that are more secure and faster than Internet Explorer, immune to most known browser hijackers, and outfitted with built-in pop-up blockers and other useful accessories.\n*NOTE*: Whatever browser you use it should be kept updated, since some of the updates are security related.\n- It is critical that you use a firewall to protect your computer from hackers. We don't recommend the firewall that comes built into Windows XP. It doesn't block everything that may try to get in, it doesn't block anything at all outbound, and the entire firewall is written to the registry. (The built-in Vista firewall blocks both incoming and outbound, but is still written to the registry). Since most malware accesses the registry and can disable the Windows firewall, it's preferable to install one of these excellent third party solutions.\n- Three good free ones are PCTools Online Armor and Outpost. The trial version of Sunbelt Kerio Personal Firewall will also work in \"free mode\" after the trial period expires. Private Firewall is compatible with 64bit systems.\nPlease only use one firewall at a time!\n*NOTE*: The Windows built-in firewall in Windows 7 also blocks both incoming and outbound and is all you need.\n- This excellent program blocks installation of many known malicious ActiveX objects. Run the program, download the latest updates, \"Enable All Protection\" and you're done. Although it won't protect you from every form of spyware known to man, it is a very potent extra layer of protection.\n- Don't forget to check for updates every week or so. Also see this tutorial by Grinler. (Note: This tutorial is for an earlier version, so there may be some minor differences)\n- Another good program is MVPS HOSTS. This little program packs a powerful punch as it blocks ads, banners, 3rd party Cookies, 3rd party page counters, web bugs, and many hijackers.\n- For information on how to download and install, please read this tutorial by WinHelp2002.\n*NOTE*: Windows 7 does not use a HOSTS file at all, so there is no need for this type of program for it.\nOther Cleaning / Protection Software\n- Spybot Search & Destroy is a good free scanner. See this topic for instructions on how to run a scan with Spybot.\n- Spybot has an \"Immunize\" feature which works roughly the same way as SpywareBlaster above.\n- Another feature within Spybot is the TeaTimer option. TeaTimer detects when known malicious processes try to start and terminates them. It also detects when something wants to change critical registry keys and prompts you to allow this or not. See this tutorial by Grinler for more information. (Note: Tutorial is for an earlier version, so there may be some minor differences)\n*NOTE*: Spybot is not as effective as some other programs now available and may even be redundant if you have other anti-spyware protection programs.\n- An outstanding all-purpose anti-malware scanner and cleaner is Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. Although there is also a paid version with added features, the free version is fully functional.\nSee This Article for details on how to download and scan with Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware.\n- Microsoft now offers their own free malicious software blocking and removal tool, \"Windows Defender\" (Not compatible with Windows 98 and ME.) It also features real-time protection.\n- Even if you plan to use an alternate browser, you will have to use Internet Explorer for tasks like updating Windows or visiting any other site that requires ActiveX. Also, since Internet Explorer is integrated into the Windows core, keeping it locked down is very important.\n- IE9 is only available for Vista and Windows 7.\n- For IE9 go here\n- For IE7 and IE 8, open IE and go to Tools > Internet Options > Security > Internet, then press \"Default Level\", then OK.\n- Now you will be asked whether you want ActiveX objects to be executed and whether you want software to be installed. Sites that you know for sure are above suspicion can be moved to the Trusted Zone in Internet Option > Security.\n- So why is ActiveX so dangerous that you have to increase the security for it? When your browser runs an ActiveX control, it is running an executable program, no different from double-clicking an exe file on your hard drive. Would you run just any file downloaded off a web site without knowing what it is and what it does?\nAlso, we suggest you check your Applications and Programs to see which ones need to be updated with either Secunia vunerability scanner or FileHippo Update Checker\nHappy safe computing!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Robotic Cameras Get Human-Like Eye Muscle\n- 6:30 AM\nImagine this: Every time you wanted to focus on something in your peripheral vision, you had to turn your whole head and torso instead of just moving your eyes. It would be a pain in the ass, yet it’s what robots that use cameras have had to do up until now. Researchers at Georgia Tech say they’ve changed that with a muscle-like device that allows cameras to mimic the human eye’s independent movement.\nWhile the work is still in the lab, lead researcher Joshua Schultz said if any of the potential partners who have approached his adviser Dr. Jun Ueda were to commit, the technology could be on the market in about a year. The implications are vast, including safer and more effective MRI-guided surgery, robotic rehabilitation for eye damage and more advanced military and surveillance applications.\nBy using electric pulses to move muscle-like components, Schultz and Ueda have found a way around the slow, loud and inefficient servo motors being used in most robotic cameras. Like the human body, this system only uses the amount of energy it needs in order to get the job done. These piezoelectric cellular actuators allow for much more flexibility and open the doors to many exciting advances in optics.\n“The fine degree of control of the camera is impressive on its own, but the potentially greater impact is the demonstration of this muscle-like actuator as a general driving force,” says Devin Neal, an MIT researcher who is one of the few other engineers working in the field. ”Such applications may be directly related to the eye such as shutter control like an eyelid, or optical zoom.”\nFor example, doctors often detect tumors during an MRI and want to operate, but due to the magnetic fields created by the machine, they are prevented from using certain exploratory equipment. “Since the ‘artificial muscle’ technology can be made without any iron, unlike electric motors, it could be used to drive the robotic device doing the surgery,” says Schultz.\nAccording to him, homeland security is another logical way the “artificial muscle” could be applied. If a robot sees something outside its initial region of interest it could rearrange the camera to focus on a new subject. As the robot is scanning a field of view it will be able to adjust and refocus discreetly and efficiently. Humanoid robots today would have to turn their “heads,” draining their battery and potentially attracting unwanted attention.\nWith the eyeball movement replicated there are still some things researchers need to master before a cylon takeover. Next up, getting the muscle-like system integrated into functioning robots. The prototype now is 7 inches square with a 3-inch cubed acctuator fit for the working station the lab had. To be commercialized, all of this would likely get smaller, Schultz says.", "label": 1}
{"text": "What Is Spear Phishing And How Can I Stop It?\nIf your business or organization is concerned about protecting your sensitive computer information, be aware that there’s a new type of Email computer threat making it’s rounds on the internet.\nKnown as Spear Phishing, this fraudulent Email poses as being sent from a “friend” and asks the recipient to click on a website or link that then infects their computer. The methods that Spear phishers use to mimic a trusted source or contact are sophisticated and the Email might even look legitimate, but one misstep from you, or anyone on your computer network, could put your business at serious risk by allowing hackers and malcontents to access critical computer information.\nIn fact, Spear Phishing is the technology that was used to facilitate the recent Shady RAT attacks that compromised 72 worldwide organizations. Although specific companies haven’t been named in the Shady RAT intrusions, they include Governments, defense contractors, and companies in various industries including construction, technology, accounting and media, according to McAfee.\nThis is why businesses and organizations worldwide need to implement Email Security policies to stop these types of malicious communications from reaching the Inboxes of any of their employees. By preventing this mail from being delivered, you eliminate the opportunity for an uninformed or distracted employee or agent to accidentally click on a link that jeopardizes your corporate infrastructure.\nThese types of computer breaches are costly and can result in hefty fines on a per incident basis, so security conscious companies and organizations would be well served to find a reliable Email security solution to prevent them before they occur.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Can you guess what the most common online password is?\nActually, you probably could guess. Internet-security firm Imperva recently reported that 123456 is the most common password. Second-most common is 12345, followed by 123456789. And the fourth most common password is “password.”\nThe firm compiled the report after gaining access to 32 million passwords that were briefly posted online, during a major security breach in December.\nThe firm recommends that even if your in-house network or the web sites you frequent don’t require you to, you should follow these rules:\n- Choose a password that contains a minimum of eight characters.\n- Include a mix of four different types of characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters such as !@#$%^&*.\nOther guidelines for creating crack-proof passwords come from Microsoft:\n- Use mnemonics to keep track of them. Start with a sentence you can remember, like “My son Aiden is three years old.”\n- Check to see whether the computer or online system supports the pass phrase directly. If so, you can use a pass phrase.\n- Convert the phrase to a password, if the web site doesn’t support phrases. Take the first letter of each word of the sentence to create a made-up word. The sample above would become “msaityo.”\n- Add complexity by substituting letters with numbers or symbols, changing lower-case to upper-case letters, or adding misspellings. Your password might become “My $oN Ayden is Tree yeeRs old.”\n- Rate your password.

{"text": "Connectedness is recognized by psychologists as an innate human need. “Social connectedness” is referred to as something determining both success in life and mental health. Some see pursuit of connectedness as one of the basic motivators underlying social behavior; the fundamental need for belonging and connectedness promotes social relationships.\nThis drive is seen in instant messaging and Facebook users who monitor availability of colleagues and exchange greetings even when they don’t want to exchange information. Awareness that others are online conveys connectedness even when there is no message exchange. Some research finds the need for connectedness to be the most important factor in making a choice between communication channels.\nThat explains a little about why everyone’s jumping on clouds, tweeting and twittering, and Facebooking. Most people have an emotional need to be connected. The complication: Because the designers of these new technologies want them to be as easy to use as possible, people don’t have to understand them in order to use them.\nLegal ethics is involved because new technology is both seductive and also inherently risky. We all want the fastest, smallest, most powerful, and best looking thingamajigs, but lawyers must understand enough about this new technology to use it competently and not put at risk clients’ secrets or work product stored on a hard drive or in a smart phone.\nNew technologies may be misunderstood, misused, misapplied. Remember all the angst over Y2K? Although we’d been using computers and electronic timers for decades, lots of time and money—and perfectly good computers—were wasted on unfounded worries that the world would plunge into chaos on New Year’s Day 2000.\nLawyers have no ethical obligation to use new technology just because it is available. But lawyers must know about new technologies, stay abreast of technological advances, and consider the risks involved in using new technology.\nEven printers can be targeted for attack nowadays. Network printers have been found to be infected with the Blaster and Sasser worms. Printers are loaded with more complex applications than ever and run all kinds of vulnerable services, and many have direct Internet connections. A network printer should be as secure as any server or workstation.\nWe all know by now that a computer lacking virus protection and intruder prevention software will soon become useless owing to viruses and malware attacks. We use WiFi networks, too, even though they are susceptible to interception by unauthorized users.\nNetworking your computer—that is, connecting it to other computers or computer networks—implicates many of the same concerns for privacy and security that arise when you use a publicly available computer or network, say at Starbucks.\nCloud service providers hawk the ability to access the cloud from any Internet browser that happens to be handy. But using public computers can be risky. Lawyers cannot afford to leave Internet footprints behind.\nSo if you use a publicly available computer to access your cloud service, your search history may be left behind, showing where you’ve been web surfing. To be safe, don’t log in to search engines or use their tools; block Google from placing cookies in your computer; regularly change your IP address; use a privacy app that deletes all search information when you’re done; don’t run searches using personal information—if you Google yourself, Google will correlate searches with your name; run sensitive searches, if you must, from a public hot spot that does not require you to log in; if your own Internet service provider (ISP) has a search engine (e.g., Comcast) don’t use it—your ISP already knows your IP address, so if you use its search engine, it can correlate your IP address to your searches and build a rather comprehensive profile about you.\nAs we all know, social networking sites generate lots of controversies and lawsuits. Many of them involve privacy violation claims. Generally, legal liabilities and obligations of social networking sites are determined under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\nUsing peer-to-peer software involves some special considerations, too. In United States v. Ladeau, No. 09-40021, 2010 WL 1427523 (D. Mass. April 7, 2010), the police remotely downloaded files from the defendant’s computer to use as evidence of his possession of child pornography. The defendant moved to quash, arguing the police had conducted a warrantless search of the defendant’s Gigatribe network, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (Gigatribe is a peer-to-peer file-sharing program that allows users to share computer files with other users in their network.) The court referenced other courts’ holdings that “users of peer-to-peer software, such as LimeWire, do not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the computer they use to run the software,” noting that “anyone who installs and uses file-sharing software is opening his computer to anyone else with the same freely available program.”\nSo, the use of file-sharing software may extinguish any expectation of privacy and may give the government license to look through the computer.\nOne way to avoid the hazards associated with the newest technologies is to wait until they aren’t so new. You don’t need to be a complete Luddite—just operate on the if-it’s-not-broke-don’t-fix-it principle. (Saves money, too.)\nCountless lawyers can’t live without a BlackBerry or smart phone. Yet, many of us have no use for one, or wouldn’t even know what to do with one.\nAt bottom, the question needing to be answered before connecting to any of these Pandora’s e-Boxes is what business purpose will it serve? Cloud services are among the newest things, but do you need them? Do your clients expect you to have such capability? Will it facilitate your representation or help you get things done?\nIf your business can remain competitive without being über connected, then stay away—you won’t have to monitor those connections, and you’ll have a little less risk to worry about.\nOn the same theory but a much smaller scale, consider that you can click to “disconnect” your computer modem at times when you don’t need an active Internet connection. You can’t get hit by Internet malware while you’re not actively connected.\nIn the words of the New York State Bar Association Committee on Professional Ethics (Op. 782, 2004), “Technology . . . is a queer thing.

{"text": "Data Integrity vs Data Security\nData are the most important asset to any organization. Therefore, it must be made sure that data is valid and secure all the time. Data integrity and Data security are two important aspects of making sure that data is useable by its intended users. Data integrity makes sure that the data is valid. Data security makes sure that data is protected against loss and unauthorized access.\nWhat is Data Integrity?\nData Integrity defines a quality of data, which guarantees the data is complete and has a whole structure. Data integrity is most often talked about with regard to data residing in databases, and referred to as database integrity as well. Data integrity is preserved only if and when the data is satisfying all the business rules and other important rules. These rules might be how each piece of data is related to each other, validity of dates, lineage, etc. According to data architecture principles, functions such as data transformation, data storage, metadata storage and lineage storage must guarantee the integrity of data. That means, data integrity should be maintained during transfer, storage and retrieval.\nIf data integrity is preserved, the data can be considered consistent and can be given the assurance to be certified and reconciled. In terms of data integrity in databases (database integrity), in order to guarantee that integrity is preserved, you have to ensure that the data becomes an accurate reflection of the universe it is modeled after. In other words, it must make sure that the data stored in the database corresponds exactly to the real world details it is modeled after. Entity integrity, referential integrity and domain integrity are several popular types of integrity constraints used for preserving data integrity in databases.\nWhat is Data Security?\nData security deals with the prevention of data corruption through the use of controlled access mechanisms. Data security makes sure that data is accessed by its intended users, thus ensuring the privacy and protection of personal data. Several technologies are used for ensuring data security. OTFE (on-the-fly-encryption) uses cryptographic techniques for encrypting data on hard drives. Hardware based security solutions prevent unauthorized read/write access to data and thus provides stronger protection compared to software based security solutions. Because software based solutions may prevent data loss or stealing but cannot prevent intentional corruption (which makes data unrecoverable/unusable) by a hacker. Hardware based two factor authorization schemes are highly secure because the attacker needs physical access to the equipment and site. But, the dongles can be stolen and be used by almost anybody else. Backing up data is also used as a mechanism against loss of data. Data masking is another method used for data security by which data is obscured. This is done to maintain the security and sensitivity of personal data against unauthorized access. Data erasure is the method of overwriting of data to ensure that data is not leaked after its life time has passed.\nWhat is the difference between Data Integrity and Data Security?\nData integrity and data security are two different aspects that make sure the usability of data is preserved all the time. Main difference between integrity and security is that integrity deals with the validity of data, while security deals with protection of data. Backing up, designing suitable user interfaces and error detection/correction in data are some of the means to preserve integrity, while authentication/authorization, encryptions and masking are some of the popular means of data security. Suitable control mechanisms can be used for both security and integrity.\n- Difference Between Network Security and Information Security\n- Difference Between Cloud Security and Cloud Access Security\n- Difference Between CCNA Security and CCNP Security and CCIE Security\n- Difference Between Information System Audit and Information Security Audit\n- Difference Between Free AVG Android Security and NetQin Android Security", "label": 1}

But after two years of \"extensive correspondence\" they only received a fraction of the reports from the company.\nDel Mar's Cochrane group then supplemented the incomplete data from Roche with reports obtained from regulators under freedom of information requests, along with leaked documents.\n\"This information has turned our understanding of the drug's effects on its head,\" the researchers say.\n\"Our review has led to the detection of numerous reporting biases and fundamental problems in trial design, and we have concluded that previous effectiveness claims were not supported by the available evidence.\"\nThe researchers also found evidence that serious adverse events were not reported in published papers.\n\"The drug companies are not publishing some of the experiments they've done,\" says Del Mar.\n\"Suspicious people around the world say 'Well, it's because those data don't say what the drug company wants to show and will affect their shareholders' interest.\"\nIn a statement to ABC Science Online, Roche stands by the efficacy and safety of Tamiflu.\nIt says it provided the Cochrane group with access to 3200 pages of very detailed information and more information was made available on a password-protected site.\n\"Roche has made full clinical study data available to global health authorities, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for their review as part of the licensing process,\" the statement says.\n\"It is the role of global health authorities to review detailed information on medicines when assessing benefit/risk.\"\nBut Del Mar says the TGA is not resourced to properly review the vast amount of information sent to them.\nHe says the better-equipped US Food and Drug Administration has rejected some claims made by Roche - including that Tamiflu reduces the complications of influenza, and hospitalisations.\nA spokeswoman for the TGA says the Australian Government has stockpiled $179 million worth of Tamiflu and the related antiviral Relenza.\nShe says TGA approves Tamiflu in Australia for the treatment and prevention of influenza but is yet to see the full data on the drug's effect on influenza complications and transmission.\n\"The TGA expects full study reports containing study protocol, reporting analysis plan, statistical analysis plan and individual patient data to clarify outstanding issues. These full clinical study reports are at present unavailable to us.\"\nAnd those reports in the TGA’s possession so far are being kept secret.\n\"At the current time the TGA does not make full clinical study reports publicly available as they are provided to the TGA as commercial-in-confidence information at the time of an application,\" the TGA spokeswoman says.\nMoves to free up data\nThe TGA is currently developing a policy on the disclosure of commercially confidential information.\nMeanwhile European regulators agree financial conflicts of interest can distort research findings and that clinical trial data should not be kept secret.\nBut they challenge the idea that independent academics are free from conflicts of interest.\n\"Personal advancement in academia, confirmation of previously defended positions, or simply raising one's own visibility within the scientific community may be powerful motivators,\" write representatives from a number of European regulators in a response to Del Mar, appearing in the same issue of PLoS Medicine.\n\"More often than not, ego trumps money.\"\nDel Mar disagrees.

{"text": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010\nTel Aviv U Researchers Working To Harden Captcha\nA research project at Tel Aviv University is tackling the problem of making Captcha more secure. Captcha is an open source program created by a team from Carnegie Mellon University. It consists of a component that shows wavy letters on Web sites and asks the visitor to type them into a box to prove he or she is human and not a bot trying to hack into a server or database.\nRecently, Captcha has begun showing vulnerabilities. Spammers have begun hiring humans to sit in front of a screen to type in the letters from Captcha images thousands of times a day, thereby getting around the security mechanism. Likewise, other, more automated hacks have been developed to exploit insecure implementations of the component, such as re-using session IDs of known Captcha images on Web sites that allow multiple data entry attempts.\nBut a research project led by Danny Cohen-Or in Tel Aviv U's Blavatnik School of Computer Sciences is testing out a new kind of Captcha code using video, which may prove harder to crack.\n\"Humans have a very special skill that computer bots have not yet been able to master,\" said Cohen-Or. \"We can see what's called an 'emergence image'--an object on a computer screen that becomes recognizable only when it's moving--and identify this image in a matter of seconds. While a person can't 'see' the image as a stationary object on a mottled background, it becomes part of our gestalt as it moves, allowing us to recognize and process it.\"\nIn a research paper co-authored with people in Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and India and presented at a recent Siggraph conference, Cohen-Or described a technique that generates pictures of 3D objects, like a running man or a flying airplane. This technique, he said, will allow developers to generate any number of moving images that will be virtually impossible for any computer algorithm to decode.\n\"Emergence\" describes the ability of humans to collect bits of information, synthesize it, and perceive it as an identifiable whole. So far, computers don't have this skill. \"Computer vision algorithms are completely incapable of effectively processing emergence images,\" explained Lior Wolf, a co-author of the study.\nArticle Courtesy of Campus Technology", "label": 1}

{"text": "Phishing and Two-Factor Authentication\nIn many cases we use passwords toauthenticate ourselves on Web sites where we make transactions, andpasswords represent only one mechanism for authentication. Passwordsare “something we know” (and something that, hopefully, no one elseknows). However, there are other ways of authenticating ourselves. Forexample, we can use “something we are”, such as a fingerprint or otherbiometric, or even “something we have”, such as an access control card.“Two-factor authentication” refers to the concept of using twoinstances of “something we know”, “something we are”, or “something wehave”. Two-factor authentication provides much stronger guarantees whencompared to using just one of these means of authentication.\nOneof the most popular forms of two-factor authentication involves the useof a hardware token that displays a sequence of digits that changes atset intervals. To authenticate ourselves on a network using thismethod, we provide our regular password in conjunction with thesequence of numbers that appear on the hardware token screen at themoment we are entering the password. While the sequence of numbers onthe token changes periodically, in what appears to be an unpredictableway to anyone looking at the token, a server is capable of validatingthe sequence at any given point in time. The password represents“something we know” and the token represents “something we have”. Oneof the biggest benefits of two-factor authentication tokens is thateven if our password is somehow leaked, we are still protected becauseonly we should be in possession of our unique hardware token. Somepeople have gone as far as claiming that, as a result, the widespreaddeployment of such tokens will solve the phishing problem. In myopinion, generally speaking, this assertion is false.\nAllow me to explain. Suppose that I browse to a phishing siteaccidentally and provide the site with a username, password, and thecurrent sequence of digits on the hardware token that is associatedwith a legitimate Web site that I transact with. As soon as I have donethis, the phisher controlling the malicious Web site will learn all ofthis information. Of course, if the phisher tries to use thisinformation to log into my account at a later time, he or she will beunsuccessful because the sequence of digits on the hardware token willhave changed by then, and, since the phisher does not possess my token,he or she will be out of luck. There is one subtle problem with theclaim I have just made in the previous sentence. If the phrase “at alater time” actually means “in one day” or “in one hour”, then thestatement is fine. But, what if “at a later time” actually means “infive seconds” or “immediately after I enter my credentials”? In thatcase, the sequence value on the token is still valid; a phisher can goahead and use it to log into my account and wreak havoc.(Alternatively, a phisher can simply hijack the current, authenticatedsession).\nThese days, most typical attacks don’t engage in this level ofsophistication. Usernames and passwords are still collected, but it isusually some time before they are used. Two-factor authenticationtokens work well for these very simple-minded attacks. However, if anattack is more sophisticated and the phisher can use the credentials inreal-time, we’re the ones out of luck. The community of securityresearchers has always known that real-time attacks are quite possibleand in fact, a prototype demonstrating such an attack was displayed atthe April 2006 meeting of the Anti-Phishing Working Group. At thattime, we still felt a certain sense of comfort that phishers were notactually attempting such sophisticated attacks. Sadly, that no longerseems to be the case. Just this past week, a phishing attempt againstCitibank contained a field for the entry of a two-factor authenticationtoken value. The window of opportunity (when the value on the token wasknown to the user) was a mere 60 seconds. This seems to suggest thatthe perpetrators were prepared, and ready to use these credentialsimmediately after they were submitted.\nIn an earlier blog entry Icommented that we are in an arms race—where phishers are leveragingmore sophisticated techniques to circumvent the technologies being putforth by the security community. This new attack further supports thatclaim, but, please don’t get me wrong. I think that two-factorauthentication tokens are very useful. They help provide securityagainst the threat of password leakage and do protect against verysimple phishing attacks. However, as with any security technology it’simportant to understand what it can and cannot do. In this regard, Ibelieve that two-factor authentication security will be almost futilewhen we tackle the next generation of phishing attacks.", "label": 1}
{"text": "One of the AVG components that is probably least understood and causes most confusion is LinkScanner. What does it do? Does it scan webpages, compare URLs against some blacklist, ask the cloud, or what? Actually it partially does all of these things, but the most important piece is the first one.\nAs you may know, there are currently around 30,000 new viruses and other malware hitting antivirus researchers’ labs each and every day. And most of them spread via the web. The web is really the primary ‘attack vector’ – or distribution medium – for modern malware. But for all these viruses, there are just a few hundred ways for them to attack your computer – infecting your system without you knowing it – either by misusing some bug in the operating system or by using some tricks to persuade you to install the malware (you can read about some of the most interesting tricks in Roger Thompson’s blog). This is the aspect of malware detection that LinkScanner is based on. It scans web page content as that content is delivered to your computer and identifies delivery mechanism patterns that indicate potential malware delivery. When it identifies something suspicious, it blocks that page. The beauty of this approach is that LinkScanner does not have to know the virus itself – it blocks the attack no matter what new malware the page is trying to deliver to you! This way, even new variants of rogue spyware products, fake codecs and other similar ‘tricks’ cannot harm your computer. LinkScanner is installed on the network layer, intercepting all web traffic regardless of which browser you use and detecting threats before the browser sees anything. That makes it even more effective.\nSome people think that, if they use a blacklist of “known-bad” web sites, they are safe and don’t need LinkScanner. Unfortunately, they are wrong. Most web threats are served from web sites that exist for less than one day – and often for only a few hours. Even more sneakily, some infected web pages serve malicious content only to certain site visitors, for example only users from particular areas. The bad guys will try anything to avoid detection. But since LinkScanner evaluates the real content of the web page right when it is delivered to your computer, it cannot be tricked in this way. Yet another reason to use\nAnother LinkScanner myth is that some people think it actually visits the web page to scan it, which would enable it to be easily identified by malicious code on the web page and spoofed. This is also not true – LinkScanner is installed on the client computer and scans incoming traffic. So the web request comes from the browser and LinkScanner only monitors what has been delivered. There’s no additional traffic and no way for the malware to tell if the client has LinkScanner installed or not.\nAs you can see, LinkScanner is pretty powerful technology. With modern threats, one technology and one protection layer is not sufficient; LinkScanner serves as a very solid extra layer in the overall AVG security system.\nHow AVG LinkScanner® works", "label": 1}
{"text": "Details of the first-ever control system malware (FAQ)\nJuly 21, 2010 4:00 AM PDT\nby Elinor Mills\nIndia, Indonesia and Iran are getting hit the most by the Stuxnet worm.\nThe security world is aflutter over new malware that has been spreading via USB devices and is programmed to steal data from systems running specific software used in utilities and industrial manufacturing plants.\nThere are a lot of moving parts to this story so we've decided to break them down and tell you what is happening and how it impacts you.\nWhat is the malware exactly?\nThe attack involves several components: a worm that spreads via USB drives and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in Windows and a Trojan backdoor that looks to see if an infected machine is running a specific type of software created by Siemens used in control systems including industrial manufacturing, utilities and even nuclear powered aircraft carriers.\nThe worm, dubbed Stuxnet, propagates by exploiting a hole in all versions of Windows in the code that processes shortcut files, ending in \".lnk,\" according to a Microsoft Malware Protection Center blog post. Merely browsing to the removable media drive using an application that displays shortcut icons, such as Windows Explorer, will run the malware without the user clicking on the icons. The worm infects USB drives or other removable storage devices that are subsequently connected to the infected machine. Those USB drives then infect other machines much like the common cold is spread by infected people sneezing into their hands and then touching door knobs that others are handling.\nThe malware includes a rootkit, which is software designed to hide the fact that a computer has been compromised, and other software that sneaks onto computers by using a digital certificates signed two Taiwanese chip manufacturers that are based in the same industrial complex in Taiwan--RealTek and JMicron, according to Chester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at Sophos. (Sophos has posted a video showing how a computer is infected on YouTube.) It is unclear how the digital signatures were acquired by the attacker, but experts believe they were stolen and that the companies were not involved.\nOnce the machine is infected, a Trojan looks to see if the computer it lands on is running Siemens' Simatic WinCC software. The malware then automatically uses a default password that is hard-coded into the software to access the control system's Microsoft SQL database. The password has been available on the Internet for several years, according to Wired's Threat Level blog.\nThe malware is stealing industrial automation layout design and control files specific to control systems, said Kevin Haley, director of Symantec Security Response. Once the malware locates the data it is looking for it encodes it and attempts to upload it to a remote server. The malware waits for a response from the server, which may contain more commands, he said.\nWhen did this problem arise?\nMicrosoft said it suspects that Stuxnet has been active for at least a month or more. An antivirus vendor in Belarus called VirusBlokAda said it discovered the malware in June. Researchers have provided technical details in this paper.\nMicrosoft released a security advisory on the issue on Friday, saying it had seen limited, targeted attacks using the exploit. Proof-of-concept exploit code for the Zero-Day Windows hole was publicly released over the weekend, and a tool to mitigate the attacks was then released by security researcher Didier Stevens.\nThe attack was first reported on the Krebs on Security blog.\nWho is impacted?\nThe top countries being affected by this attack are India, Indonesia and Iran, while the U.S. is in the top 6, according to Symantec.\nHow widespread is it?\nSiemens doesn't know how many systems have been affected but has learned of one infection at a Germany customer site that resulted in no damage, said spokesman Michael Krampe. \"We do not have any indication that WinCC users in other countries have been affected,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday.\nSince control systems are typically not connected to the Internet, USB drives are a logical way to try to infect them. However, plant operators tend to restrict access to critical control system data via USB drives to prevent security compromises, said Krampe.\nMeanwhile, Symantec researchers said they are seeing between 8,000 and 9,000 infection attempts a day.\nWhat does it mean for consumers?\nInfected computers that are not running the Siemens software will merely spread the worm to USB devices that are plugged into the computer thereafter until the infection is cleaned up. However, there is the risk is that someone else will use the exploit to distribute malware that is more dangerous and which will target systems other than those running the Siemens software, Wisniewski said.\nIs there a fix?\nThe worm is detected by the major antivirus software and update-to-date virus signatures are being tested by Siemens and should be approved for use by the end of the week, Siemens' Krampe said. Siemens is working on a security update for its Simatic software to address the issue and will provide a software tool this week that customers can use to check for the virus on their PCs. Customers should check the Siemens support site for updates.\nMicrosoft is also working on a patch and has provided instructions for a workaround in a security advisory, in the meantime. The workaround includes disabling the display of icons for shortcuts and disabling the WebClient service. Microsoft is no longer providing support for Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2000 and therefore will not be providing patches for them. So computers running those versions of Windows will be vulnerable until they are upgraded to newer versions.\nThe Microsoft workaround protects computers from being infected by the worm, however it changes all the desktop icons into generic white paper icons which may cause confusion for many non-tech savvy users, Wisniewski of Sophos said. He goes into more detail and provides a screen shot in this blog post.\nBusinesses with IT staff will be better able to handle the workaround and can adopt other fixes, such as setting Windows to not allow any files to execute that are not on the C Drive, which would prevent the computer from running software on USB drives, Wisniewski said.\nMicrosoft and VeriSign have also revoked the digital certificate used to sneak the rootkit onto computers but Sophos' Wisniewski said in his tests the malware still loads up with no warning to the user despite the revocation.\nHow serious is this?\nThe attack poses greater risk for operators of control systems and moves such direct cyberthreats from the realm of theory into reality, experts say. \"Finding an exploit in the wild is a major eye opener,\" one control system expert said. \"This is a very well thought out exploit.\"\n\"This is the first case we know of where there is a very well-constructed intentionally targeted virus aimed at industrial control system applications,\" said Joe Weiss, author of \"Protecting Industrial Control Systems from Electronic Threats\" and a longtime control system security gadfly.\nMeanwhile, this type of attack is not even addressed in the industry guidelines--called NERC CIP, which stands for \"North American Electric Reliability Corp. critical infrastructure protection\" standards, illustrating that the industry is ill-prepared to protect against such threats, Weiss said.\nThere has been malware that affected control systems previously, such as the 2004 SQL Slammer worm, but none that was written specifically to attack such systems, said Jonathan Pollet, founder of Red Tiger Security, a critical infrastructure consultancy.\n\"The attackers could be looking for installations where the Siemens software is present, or they could be looking to do a secondary attack on those systems,\" Pollet said. \"The big question is who is funding this effort?\"\nThe Internet Storm Center raised its Infocon threat level to \"Yellow\" on Monday because of the worm. \"Although we have not observed the vulnerability exploited beyond the original targeted attacks, we believe wide-scale exploitation is only a matter of time,\" the group wrote in a blog post. \"The proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available, and the issue is not easy to fix until Microsoft issues a patch. Furthermore, antivirus tools' ability to detect generic versions of the exploit have not been very effective so far.\"\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) released its advisory (PDF) on the threat on Tuesday.\nWhat about changing those default Siemens passwords?\nSiemens spokesman Krampe says don't do it. Changing the password would interrupt communications between the WinCC software and the database and interfere with the operations. Siemens is examining ways to increase the security of the authentication procedures, he said.\nUsing hard-coded passwords is done across the control systems industry, said Weiss.\n\"What happens if you forget your password? It's the OnStar for control systems,\" he said. \"You can't afford to just have the system totally locked up...vendors also want to be able to track their equipment in the field and provide remote maintenance.\"\nWho is behind this and why are they doing it?\nIndustrial espionage appears to be the motivation because of the type of data being stolen, but it's unclear who is behind the attack. Industrial espionage has been a concern for years but intensity has ramped up since attacks on Google and other companies last year that Google said originated in China and targeted source code.\nThis could cause some pretty heavy damage to a country if directed against nuclear power plants or control systems managing the electricity or water grids. Do you see cyber warfare as a potential source of threat to global peace in the future? How will a country respond to a major attack when it usually takes a considerable amount of time to trace the whereabouts of the attacker.\nCyberwar: War in the fifth domain\nThe threat from the internet: Cyberwar", "label": 1}
{"text": "Consumers sacrifice privacy for better technology, despite risks\nProponents argue that there are many benefits to the procedure. One proponent, PositiveID, a company based in Florida, specializes in implanting a small chip into a customer’s body that holds his or her health records. The benefit is not that obvious, but makes sense: If a customer is a victim of a serious car accident, for instance, and is unconscious or unable to provide critical information, paramedics have instant access to the victim’s important health records via the data chip. These records will facilitate urgent treatment. Some say that such technology saves lives and should be, in some cases, mandatory.\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that such an Orwellian procedure is the beginning of a slippery slope towards a society in which citizens are constantly monitored—and even manipulated by ill-intentioned forces. Many point to issues of security and privacy violation. Perhaps the most compelling objection to the idea, in my opinion, involves hypothetical scenarios in which health records are linked to credit scores.\nI think both arguments are rather silly, especially the former. Why? Well, the great majority of us already have chips. In other words, we may not have chips implanted in our arms or brains, but we certainly have chips in our pockets: they are called cell phones.\nEqually laughable is the alarm caused by a recent article published by The New York Times entitled “It’s Tracking Your Every Move and You May Not Even Know”. The article, which has caused quite a stir, reveals just how cell phone companies store massive amounts of data about a customer’s location at any given time. While the average consumer can surmise that cell phone companies are able to store and use this data, no proof of these capabilities has been revealed in certain terms until now. Still, it is not that shocking. Perhaps the only shock is how much consumers depend on private companies to guard customer data and use it for “benign” purposes.\nOften, our faith in companies to do the right thing comes as a result of our dependency on their products. I am sure that when cell phones, equipped with GPS features, were introduced to the market, consumers had major privacy and other legitimate concerns. However, after billions of cell phones were sold and a few years passed, those concerns faded, weakened by what has become a necessary technology. The same could happen with the nascent, implant debate mentioned earlier.\nIn short, the amount of data stored by companies about customers goes way beyond location records obtained by cell phone usage or health records stored by chip implants. This is just the tip of the iceberg, as it were. And, most of us know it. The New York Times article focuses on Germany, not the United States where cell phone companies do not have to report what information they collect. Here in the United States, companies are probably more advanced. Regardless, consumers all over the world must understand that as technology advances, so too must the effort to protect individual privacy. It is the only solution in a highly technological world where “unplugging” is not an option.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Editor’s Note: David Wise is the author of numerous books on national security, intelligence and espionage. His latest book, Tiger Trap: America’s Secret Spy War with China, was published June 14 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\nBy David Wise – Special to CNN\nFor almost half a century during the Cold War, the world focused on the global espionage battle between the United States and the Soviet Union. The duel between the CIA and the KGB, portrayed in countless books, films and news stories captured the public imagination.\nEspionage became a kind of entertainment thanks in no small part to the fictional exploits of James Bond. This fiction masked a cold reality.\nIn the actual conflict, spies and their agents died. Lives were shattered. The KGB's supermoles - Aldrich Ames in the CIA and Robert Hanssen in the FBI - stole U.S. secrets by the trunkful and betrayed agents working for U.S. intelligence. Many of those agents were executed.\nA the East-West intelligence battles played out in back alleys across the globe, scant attention was paid to the espionage operations of a rising global power– China. And scant attention was paid to the efforts of U.S. counterintelligence (not always successful) to counter Beijing's attempts to acquire America's secrets.\nInside the FBI, Soviet spies were regarded as the principal quarry. Chinese counterintelligence was relegated to a back seat. Yet, China has spied on America for decades with some spectacular but little known results.\nDuring World War II, Soviet spies penetrated the Manhattan Project and stole U.S. atomic secrets. That was not lost on China. In the decades after World War II, Chinese espionage was principally aimed at stealing U.S. nuclear weapons data. By acquiring those secrets, China could bypass years of research and testing and speed its own development of nuclear weapons.\nWith its modernization efforts devastated by the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China coveted such shortcuts. So the United States, particularly the nuclear weapons labs at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore, became its primary target.\nThe FBI suspected that Gwo-Bao Min, an engineer at the Livermore lab, had passed the secrets of the neutron bomb to China. The case was given the code-name TIGER TRAP by the Bureau. Although the FBI gathered considerable evidence, the Justice Department declined to authorize an arrest. However, Min was forced to resign from the nuclear weapons lab.\nAnother priority of Chinese intelligence has been to infiltrate U.S. counterintelligence. The F.B.I. was penetrated until 2002 by Katrina Leung, a prominent figure in the Chinese American community in Los Angeles who worked as an F.B.I. asset for twenty years under the code name PARLOR MAID.\nLeung was having affairs with the bureau's two top agents on the West Coast responsible for Chinese counterintelligence, James J. Smith and William V. Cleveland, Jr. She fed F.B.I. secrets to China’s foreign intelligence service, the M.S.S., for years, telling investigators she filched them from Smith's briefcase during their trysts at her home.\nF.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III assigned his top counterintelligence agent, Leslie G. Wiser, Jr., to go to Los Angeles in 2002 and investigate. Operating with a team of handpicked agents from a secret location in Santa Monica, Wiser broke open the case. Leung and Smith were arrested. Smith pleaded guilty to lying about his affair with Leung. She, too, pleaded guilty to lying about their affair and to failing to report some of her income from the F.B.I. Neither was sentenced to prison. And the government had avoided a sensational espionage trial in which the Bureau’s secrets might have been aired.\nThe CIA was also penetrated by Chinese intelligence. A mole named Larry Wu-Tai Chin worked for Chinese intelligence for more than 30 years until he was caught by the FBI in 1985.\nThere have been many more recent examples of Chinese spying against the United States. Dongfan \"Greg\" Chung volunteered to spy for China. Chung, a naturalized U.S. citizen, worked in the aerospace industry in southern California for thirty years.\nAt Boeing he was a stress analyst on the space shuttle. Chung sent twenty-four manuals from Rockwell to China on the B-1 bomber. When the F.B.I. searched his home in California in 2006 they were astonished to find 300,000 pages of Boeing documents hidden in the house pertaining to the space shuttle, rockets and military aircraft. Some of the documents were in a crawl space underneath the house. Chung was arrested, convicted and sentenced in 2010 to almost sixteen years in prison.\nChina and the United States have a mutual dependence and a common interest in avoiding conflict. Without exaggerating the danger of Chinese espionage, it is a fact that China’s spying on America is ongoing, current and shows no sign of diminishing.\nChinese computer hackers have penetrated the Pentagon, the State Department and U.S. companies, such as Google.\nAmericans should be aware that China, when it can, steals U.S. secrets. The espionage battle is no less real for being largely unseen.\nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of David Wise.\nThe Global Public Square is where you can make sense of the world every day with insights and explanations from CNN's Fareed Zakaria, leading journalists at TIME and CNN, and other international thinkers.

{"text": "Identity Theft & Phishing\nA Note About Identity Theft and Phishing\nThere have recently been an increasing number of attempts on the Internet to trick people into revealing sensitive and private information about themselves to con artists who use that information to defraud them. The latest scam, popularly called 'phishing', uses replicas of existing web pages to deceive users. These replicated pages prompt the user to enter personal, financial or password data. We encourage you to review this communication, which includes tips to protect your financial institution and end users.\nWhat is Phishing?\nPhishing is a term coined by Internet hackers who use email lures to 'fish' passwords and financial data from the sea of Internet users. Email messages designed to look like they came from a merchant or financial institution are mailed to Internet users. The emails direct the recipient to update or provide information back to the company's web site by instructing the user to click on a URL embedded within the email. The embedded URL links the user to a counterfeit web site designed to look like the company's legitimate web site. Passwords and other personal information are then solicited and collected by the web site and used by the scammer to defraud the user.\nTo date, large financial institutions have been the primary targets of these phishing scams. It is prudent to expect that smaller financial institutions may also be targeted.\nWhat Can You Do to Protect Yourself and Your Identity?\n- Do not trust or act upon unsolicited emails that request personal information such as passwords, credit card numbers, ATM PINs, social security numbers, etc.\n- Fraudulent emails are typically not personalized with Peoples Bank information.\n- Fraudulent email often present end users with scenarios of negative consequences if they do not act immediately on the email's instructions.\n- Fraudulent email messages often contain flawed English.\n- Do not fill out forms contained in email messages requesting sensitive information.\n- Personal information should be provided by calling your financial institution directly or by logging onto their secure web site by typing the URL (web address) into your browser.\n- Type https://www.peoplesbankdirect.com into your browser and bookmark it. Use the bookmark derived from hand-typing the address for all subsequent visits to your financial institution's website.\n- Keep your web browser patches up to date.\n- Regularly access your browser's website to download security patches. Patching your browser regularly will protect you against a variety of software vulnerabilities.\n- Regularly log in to your online accounts. If you see anything unusual, report it immediately to your financial institution.\n- Pay close attention to your bank, credit card and debit card statements. If you see anything suspicious, immediately contact your financial institution and the card issuer.\nIf you receive an email claiming to be from your financial institution, but which you suspect is aimed at defrauding you, contact your financial institution and the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.\nPeoples Bank will NEVER send you an email requesting a username or password.\nFDIC Special Alert Regarding Fraudulent Emails\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has received numerous reports from consumers who received an e-mail that has the appearance of being sent from the FDIC.

{"text": "Datacenter Content Sponsored By: Phoenix Nap\nA data center is a facility designed to store large amounts of equipment connected to computers, electronics and communications. Usually maintained by organizations in order to handle core operations in information services, including Internet connectivity, intranets, LANS, WANS, and extranets – practically every size of company, has some manner of data center. The most basic data center will have a computer network, including backup power supplies, air conditioning, and security applications, which amounts to a very large amount of data, stored in a large number of computers. Generally, the larger a company is, the larger the data center(s) will be. While larger companies may house their own data centers, smaller firms may opt to outsource its I.T. infrastructure or corporate computer information to a data center, suited to storing confidential, critical systems and business information.\nIt is important for a company to have access to a data center, logically, because this is where a great deal of the core equipment that is essential to its operations will be located. Much like the brain in a human body, without it, a company would not be able to run efficiently. Computers and communication elements, in addition to many other vital components, are what keep a business operating.\nInternet Servers and Network Infrastructure\nAlso located inside of the data center, are various types of Internet servers. Data centers are often built and secured physically as well as logistically, to protect the equipment and data that they store. Security is an extremely important segment of a data center’s existence. Often designed as some of the most safe environments in a city, the main purpose of the data center is to maintain and run applications so that the businesses they serve, may access and manage data files effectively.\nNetwork infrastructure communications in data centers are most often based on networks running the IP protocol suite. Data centers contain a set of routers and switches that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world. Some of the servers at the data center are used for running the basic Internet and intranet services needed by internal users in the organization, such as email, proxy and DNS servers ( Domain Name System (or Service) – that translates domain names into IP addresses). Network security elements are also usually deployed, such as firewalls, VPN (virtual private network – a private data network that makes use of the public telecommunication infrastructure). Also commonplace, are network monitoring and application systems.\nWhile there are many types of information that may be stored in data centers, one example for a financial institution, would be essential, critical, security-dependent client accounts, including confidential numbers, and names, as well as business projects. A bank’s data center will usually have a mainframe or other kind of network, where its information and other data are stored. Another example is a university, which would include employee and student information, as well as data about the university’s physical holdings, such as buildings. Other information stored for a university, might be data on construction projects, as well as intellectual history. In addition, government institutions and companies that have multiple headquarters, as well as television, mobile phone, and other similar services, rely upon data centers heavily, to store and access a company or person’s critical data.\nOne of the most important functions of the data center, is security and maintenance. This is because ultimately, the data center is a computer system’s most vulnerable component. If the data center is large or contains large amounts of sensitive information, video camera surveillance and permanent security guards will probably be present. Physical security requires that personal access is usually restricted to a select few individuals.\nIn addition to general types of security, since the information stored within the data center, is very critical to the operation of a company, it should be protected from other types of loss, as well as theft. The security measures employed by data centers need to be strong enough to handle climate control, and contain backup systems which rely on battery power, so that they may continue to function in the case of an interruption of electrical power.\nWith regard to web hosting, data centers are employed to store servers (housing shared accounts, dedicated servers, or colocated servers) and other types of applications. The physical layout of a data center may occupy from one room of a building, one or more floors, up to an entire building. The equipment is often in the form of 1U type servers, situated in 19 inch rack cabinets, usually placed in single rows, with corridors between them, for easy access. Mainframe computers, storage devices and other kinds of equipment (such as cooling units, fire suppression, uninterruptible power supplies), often as large as the racks, are sometimes placed alongside of them.\nThe Planet is an example of a company that offers colocation services. You can read an overview of their data centers here:http://www.theplanet.com/why_the_planet/data_centers/. The company also offers something which is almost colocation – or maybe more like a hybrid of colocation and dedicated servers. The company calls it private racks – read up on it here: http://www.theplanet.com/specialized_solutions/private_racks/.\nA long-time player in the colocation space is a company called Level 3. According to the Level 3 website, the company has laid a network that spans 47,000 miles – and is continuously upgradable.

A groundbreaking ‘privacy by design’ technique developed by EU-funded researchers promises biometric security without the risks.\nMost biometric security systems store templates of a particular biometric feature of a person, such as a fingerprint, hand print or iris scan, in a database or on a chip in a smart card or electronic token. The templates are then matched with the image generated when a person uses a scanner to enter a building, access a bank account or boot up their laptop computer. It is a highly accurate way of authenticating someone's identity, whether used on its own or in combination with other information, such as their name, ID number, date of birth or a password or pin code.\nBut what happens if that biometric image and associated data falls into the wrong hands or is used for purposes other than originally intended?\nA fingerprint scan, after all, can be directly traced back to the person who generated it, and scans stored in different databases could be cross-referenced to build up a complete profile of a person, matching their healthcare records, for example, to their employment information. Because biometric information is so intrinsically personal and can't be easily changed, a stolen biometric identity could have life-long consequences that would be almost impossible to put right. In effect, once biometric information is compromised it is compromised forever.\nThe privacy implications are enormous, but they could soon be largely solved.\nA new technique developed by a team of European researchers working in the EU-funded 'Trusted revocable biometric identities' (Turbine) project offers all the benefits of biometric security while mitigating or eliminating the associated risks.\nIn one of the world's first practical applications of so-called crypto-biometrics, the team demonstrated a solution based on the concept of 'privacy by design' that enables people to use their fingerprints to prove who they are while keeping their identity information safe.\n'Instead of storing scans of fingerprints, we are using scans to generate a mathematical code that represents an identity. The code cannot be used to restore the original fingerprint sample, it can be revoked at any time and the same fingerprint can be used to generate multiple codes so people can have different identities or pseudo-identities for different purposes,' explains Nicolas Delvaux, a programme manager at biometric security company Morpho, part of the Safran group, in France and the coordinator of Turbine.\nIrreversible and revocable\nThe code – a cryptographic bit-string key – is generated by a mathematical formula based on stable characteristics of the person's fingerprint and instructions on how a fingerprint reader should find those characteristics. Each time a person uses a biometric system based on the Turbine technology, the bit-string key their fingerprint generates – not the image of their fingerprint – is matched against the previously saved key. It simply authenticates that the person using the system is authorised, without identifying who they are. In this way, their real identity and their real biometric information remains secure.\nI am a banker, for example, and someone comes along wanting to access an account. In this context, it doesn't matter to me who they are, just that they are the only person who, with part of their body, can generate the code that gives access to that account,' Mr Delvaux says.\nA single person could have different bit-string keys for different systems, one, for example, to identify them in the government social security system, another to access their bank account, all generated using the same fingerprint. Or, in a different set up and using a different mathematical formula to generate the code, users could all have the same key to prove they are a member of a certain group or have a certain level of security clearance, for example.\nMost significantly, the bit-code keys can be revoked by the user at any time. If one is stolen or misused, it can be cancelled and a new one generated.\n'You can never revoke your biometry – I mean, you could change your fingerprint but it's extremely difficult to do and not something most people would do... People have 10 fingers so with current systems there are just 10 times a person can generate a new identity. But you can easily generate a new key from a fingerprint as many times as you like,' Mr Delvaux notes.\nAnd because the keys for different applications are all unique there is simply no way to identify users across different systems and databases.\n'Let's say you have an account at two different banks. If the banks merge, there is no way the new bank would be able to identify you as having two accounts without your consent,' Mr Delvaux explains.\nThe technology was demonstrated in a real-world trial and a proof-of-concept application.\nThe trial focused on physical access control using a biometric security system installed at Thessaloniki International Airport in Greece. Airport staff were given contact-less smart cards to store their pseudo-identities generated by the Turbine system. By using these together with a fingerprint reader on doors and gates they were able to access restricted areas of the airport building.\nThe proof-of-concept is a web-application for health professionals, with pharmacists in Germany using pseudo-identities stored on a smart card and fingerprint readers to verify their identity when they sign electronic prescriptions. One of the project partners is planning to develop a commercial version.\n'The trials were very successful and show the wide range of applications for this technology, however, there are still some hurdles to overcome,' the project coordinator notes.\nThough several of the partners, including Morpho, are planning to develop commercial products based on work done in Turbine, there is still the issue, as with other biometric systems, of gaining approval from national data protection agencies.\n'It is still very fragmented in Europe with regard to data protection... though we are planning to approach some with our technology and we are active in standardisation efforts,' Mr Delvaux explains.\nNonetheless, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) issued a broadly positive opinion on Turbine's work, the first time it has done so for a European research project.\n'By making the biometric representations irreversible, the system shall prevent the use of biometric data for any other purpose than the one originally intended. It also ensures that the biometric data themselves are not kept for longer than necessary, as they are replaced by the bit-string key… This security aspect is further strengthened by the aspect of revocability of the key,' the EDPS stated.\n'It shows that our approach, in many respects, is in line with the EDPS's data protection principles,' Mr Delvaux says. 'That's very encouraging.'\nTurbine received EUR 6.35 million in EU support under the Seventh Framework Programme for research, sub-programme 'Secure, dependable and trusted infrastructures'.\n- Spotlight on EU projects in trust and security\n- Researchers prove safety of quantum cryptology\n- What is the identity of identity in the digital age?\n- Country: GERMANY\n- Information Source: Nicolas Delvaux, programme manager, Morpho, France\n- Date: 2011-08-18", "label": 1}
{"text": "Notes on the HITECH ActDec 2nd, 2009 | By HITECH Helper | Category: Features, Meaningful Use\nTo help stimulate the economy, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law on February 17, 2009 by President Barack Obama. A large part of the Recovery Act addresses health information technology. It gives incentives for hospitals and business to switch to electronic health record systems. These changes are expected to improve the quality of care and result in cost savings to the health care system.\nHowever, a potential problem with electronic health records and information is they can be easily copied, stolen or compromised. As a result, widespread adoption of such systems won't occur unless the privacy and security of patient information can be protected.\nTo meet these challenges, the Recovery Act contains significant revisions to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security requirements.\nWhat Is the Purpose of the HITECH ACT?\nSome states require a patient be notified if the security of their personal data has been breached. These laws generally cover personal information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers and banking information, etc. However, only a few states have extended such laws to health information. The federal government has now addressed this issue.\nThere's a need to address threats and risks to this data as more businesses and hospitals electronically store their patients' information. The HITECH Act attempts to address the privacy and security concerns surrounding this information.\nThe fear is that hospitals may rush to start using the new technology just to receive the benefits under the Recovery Act. However, while hospitals and doctors are given incentives to use new health information technology, they'll also face bigger consequences if a data breach happens. Doctors and hospitals must implement the health information technology quickly but carefully.\nHow Are HIPAA and the HITECH Act Related?\nOne of the goals of HIPAA was to encourage individual control over personal health records. However, HIPAA didn't address or regulate the privacy or security of health information held by people who work with personal health records.\nWhat Does the HITECH Act Require?\nThe HITECH Act includes several new requirements that were implied in HIPAA, such as:\n• Notifying individuals when security breaches occur\n• Regulating personal health record vendors\n• Establishing more duties and penalties for business associates\n• Increasing limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information\n• Enforcing penalties when a breach has occurred\nWhat Is a Data Breach under the HI\nA data breach is when a patient's health information is made public or accessed by someone other than authorized personnel. For example, if the computer where the information is stored is stolen or hacked. The HITECH Act has strict standards for notification when such breaches occur. It also extends the group of potential violators to “covered entities.” Covered entities are defined as health plans, health care clearinghouses and treatment providers who send or receive electronic information.\nThese groups must notify you if your protected health information has been accessed, acquired or disclosed as a result of a breach. This notice requirement applies to breaches that occur in both electronic and paper format.\nThe HITECH Act Extends the Notice Requirement\nHITECH addresses privacy and security concerns by extending the notice requirements when a breach occurs, to broader category of people including:\n• Personal health record vendors\n• Entities that offer products or services through a Web site of a personal health record vendor\n• Entities that access information in, or send information to, a personal health record vendor\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will govern this aspect of the HITECH Act.\nThe HITECH Act Extends to Business Associates\nUnder HIPAA, business associates of health care providers were only indirectly subject to the security requirements. Now, the privacy and security requirements, and the penalties for non-compliance, have been expressly extended to business associates. This means that a breach of an agreement's terms can subject the associate to civil and criminal penalties.\nThe HITECH Act Sets Limits on Marketing\nThe HITECH Act also changes how personal health information can be used for marketing. There are specific rules governing the use or disclosure of such information, even for fundraising purposes. Furthermore, the sale of personal health records isn't allowed without authorization from the patient.\nPenalties under the HITECH Act\nThe HITECH Act adds to HIPAA's enforcement capabilities by increasing penalty amounts and requiring formal investigations of potential breaches. It allows state attorneys general to bring civil actions for potential HIPAA violations. There are also fines for violations. The amount of the fine depends on whether the law was violated intentionally or unintentionally and whether the violation was corrected. Penalties can range from $100 to $50,000 per violation.\nAs a result of the HITECH Act, health care businesses need to evaluate their operations to see how they can comply with its requirements. Finally, you as a patient will likely be enjoying more privacy protections due to the passing of the HITECH Act.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The Stuxnet worm may have actually pushed forward Iran’s controversial nuclear programme over the long term.\nThat’s according to a report published by the Royal United Services Institute, an influential defence think tank in the UK.\nThe infamous worm infected systems at Iran’s uranium enrichment facility at Natanz in 2009 and 2010, hobbling high-speed centrifuges after infecting computers connected to SCADA industrial control systems at the plant.\nThe sophisticated attack, seen as an alternative to a military strike against the facility, is credited with putting Iran’s nuclear programme back by between 18 months to two years. The malware worked by infiltrating the SCADA systems used to run the high-speed gas centrifuges. It then randomly, and surreptitiously, speeded them up and slowed them down to induce seemingly random, but frequent, failures.\nHowever, a journal article published by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) claims that Iranian authorities redoubled their efforts after Stuxnet was discovered, so that production of fissile material went up – rather than down – a year after the SCADA-busting worm was discovered.\nThe malware acted as a wake-up call that prompted the Iranians to throw more resources at the nuclear project, bonded personnel together and prompted security audits that uncovered vulnerabilities that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, the Daily Telegraph also noted.\nThe Obama administration last year leaked its role in developing Stuxnet as part of a wider US-Israeli effort, codenamed Operation Olympic Games, that began under the presidency of George W. Bush. Public revelation of this suspected role thwarted the slim possibility of a diplomatic resolution to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, while acting to put the country closer towards a war footing with Israel.\nThe Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security claimed in February 2011 that Stuxnet likely destroyed about 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges, out of 9,000 deployed at Natanz.\nYet Ivanka Barzashka, an academic at King’s College, London, who penned the RUSI article, reckons the initial impact of the worm has been overestimated by those left somewhat awestruck by the effect of the world’s first cyber-weapon.\n“While Stuxnet may have had the potential to seriously damage Iranian centrifuges, evidence of the worm’s impact is circumstantial and inconclusive,” she wrote in the RUSI journal. “Related data shows that the 2009 version of Stuxnet was neither very effective nor well-timed and, in hindsight, may have been of net benefit to Tehran.”\nBarzashka’s analysis is primarily based on publicly available data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (a dedicated “IAEA and Iran” microsite is available here).\nIran decommissioned and replaced about 1,000 high-speed IR-1 centrifuges at its fuel enrichment plant (FEP) at Natanz over just a few months starting late in 2009. But since August 2010 the number of operational machines at Natanz has been “steadily growing”, as Barzashka claimed in her piece:\nIran began enrichment to 20 per cent in one IR-1 cascade at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz in February 2010, ostensibly to manufacture its own fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which is used to produce medical isotopes. This development shows that Iran was able to successfully install and operate new machines in early 2010, between the first and second Stuxnet attack waves. If Stuxnet was the cause of the drop in machine numbers at block A26, it had no effect on Iran’s ability to operate and install new IR-1 centrifuges several months later.\nThe Natanz FEP began operation in February 2007, but prior to Stuxnet could only produce enrichment levels of 3.5 per cent, which is suitable only as low-grade reactor fuel. Barzashka explained that IAEA physical inventory data on the number of centrifuges installed at the Iranian facility are potentially misleading because machines have constantly been installed and upgraded over time.\n“Calculations show that performance at the FEP – measured as separative capacity – has increased every year since the beginning of operations in 2007,” she writes. “Data for the 2010 reporting period – from 22 November 2009 to November 2010 – are no exception. In fact, uranium-enrichment capacity grew during the time that Stuxnet was said to have been destroying Iranian centrifuges.”\nIran produced more enriched uranium, more efficiently: the entire plant’s separative capacity per day increased by about 40 per cent, despite the fluctuations in centrifuge numbers.\nIn January 2010, Iran was running 1,148 centrifuges fewer than it had operating seven months earlier, in May 2009. In August 2010, IAEA inspectors counted the same number of machines as in August 2008, giving rise to the probable source of the claim that Stuxnet set back Iran’s enrichment programme by two years.\nBoth of these raw figures are misleading, according to the defence analyst.\nBarzashka reckons that while Stuxnet might have temporarily slowed Iran, at least in 2009, its operations emerged from the aftermath of the worm leaner and meaner. Its technicians improved centrifuge performance before achieving higher concentrations and greater volumes of enriching uranium than before.\nWorse yet, the Iranians are far more wary about – and better prepared to defend against – future cyber-attacks against their nuclear facilities by possible successors to Stuxnet.\n“Iran’s uranium-enrichment capacity increased and, consequently, so did its nuclear weapons potential,” Barzashka wrote. “The malware – if it did in fact infiltrate Natanz – has made the Iranians more cautious about protecting their nuclear facilities,\n“The malware did not set back Iran’s enrichment programme, though perhaps it might have temporarily slowed down Iran’s rate of expansion. Most importantly, Stuxnet or no Stuxnet, Iran’s uranium enrichment capacity increased and, consequently, so did its nuclear weapons potential.” she concludes.\nFormer Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind criticised Barzashka’s report before stressing that bilateral diplomatic talks between the US and Iran remain the best way to address Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n“Part of the objective of many people in the international community has been to stop, or if you can’t stop, to slow down the Iranian nuclear programme,” Rifkind, chairman of Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee told the Telegraph. “In so far as Stuxnet may have done that, and I emphasise may have done that, it was a plus.”\n“What is undoubted is that it [Stuxnet] significantly slowed down the enrichment process,” he added. ®\nArticle source: http://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/21/stuxnet_helped_iran_says_boffin/", "label": 1}
{"text": "Is AES encryption crackable?\nIn the field of computer technology, some topics are so frequently and fiercely disputed that they almost resemble religious feuds -- Mac vs. PC, for instance, or open source vs. proprietary software.\nOther topics, though, don't see nearly the same level of high-profile debate. Take the invulnerability of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, for example. Governments and businesses place a great deal of faith in the belief that AES is so secure that its security key can never be broken. However, a team of researchers from Germany, France and Israel has recently demonstrated what may be an inherent flaw in AES -- theoretically, at least.\nSo how secure is AES really? Is AES now vulnerable to a new attack, as the researchers claim?\nMaybe yes, and maybe no. The research is mainly theoretical. Still, as technology evolves, successful attacks against AES may turn up, and they may be difficult to ignore.\n\"Can somebody repurpose and weaken the strength of the AES algorithm? Yes. That's what cryptographers do. But we don't have to worry about AES being weakened anytime soon. Still, AES in theory has flaws. The bottom line is that AES isn't broken,\" Ozzie Diaz, president and CEO of wireless security firm AirPatrol, told TeckNewsWorld.\nWhat is it?\nThe AES protocol is a set of three block ciphers selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2000 after a three-year competition. NIST is a federal technology agency that develops and promotes measurement standards. Its selection ousted Data Encryption Standard (DES) as the national and international security encryption standard. DES was the most widely deployed block cipher in both software and hardware applications.\nWhy should you care? AES encryption is the vault that secures online information and financial transactions by financial institutions, banks and e-commerce sites. So a tear in the AES fabric means an opening for hackers to get at valuable personal and business information.\nAES is used in three versions: AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. These numbers represent the encryption key sizes (128 bits, 192 bits and 256 bits) and in their number of rounds (10, 12, and 14, respectively) required to open the vault that is wrapped around the data.\nIn their published report, entitled \"Key Recovery Attacks of Practical Complexity on AES Variants With Up to 10 Rounds\" (PDF available here), three researchers challenged the structural integrity of the AES protocol.\nAlthough the research suggests AES might no longer be considered theoretically secure, the crucial question facing all of us now is how far it is from becoming practically insecure, concluded Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich (University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg), Orr Dunkelman (of Paris, France), Nathan Keller (Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University) and Adi Shamir (Computer Science department of the the Weizmann Institute at Rehovot, Israel).\n\"The findings discussed in 'Key Recovery Attacks of Practical Complexity on AES Variants With Up to 10 Rounds' are academic in nature and do not threaten the security of systems today. But because most people depend on the encryption standard to keep sensitive information secure, the findings are nonetheless significant,\" Fred Touchette, AppRiver senior security analyst, told TechNewsWorld.\nA new worry?\nIf AES is now theoretically compromised, the real-world impact could be considerable, according to Diaz.\n\"My speculation is that the greatest vulnerabilities will be for wireless systems for two reasons. Most investments in network media are in wireless systems, and there is no physical barrier to entry for accessing the network,\" he said.\nHowever, some good may come from even an academic demonstration of a flaw in AES, he conceded. Inflection points always occur in an industry in the form of disruptions. A disruption to the viability of a system today will lead to innovation in filling those gaps or completely changing the rules of the game, he said.\n\"AES is the standard in wireless and IT encryption. It keeps the mouse trap evolving faster than the mouse can move,\" said Diaz.\nCracked or broken?\nThe AES crypto is not broken, asserted Touchette. As in previous techniques, the latest attack techniques on AES-192 and AES-256 algorithms are impractical outside of a theoretical setting.\n\"But they do nonetheless provide theoretical proof that versions of AES could be susceptible to attack,\" he warned.\nWhen these cryptos became a new standard, they were declared completely unbreakable. Many other algorithms out there still remain unbreakable, but as long as our systems get stronger and faster, the need for longer and tougher encryption will also grow. Just because the puzzles get harder doesn't mean that people will stop trying to solve them, he added.\nAn early warning\n\"AES is not compromised. It is safe to use. There are no problems with it,\" Paul Kocher, president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, told TechNewsWorld.\nStill, researchers are finding that it would not take as much to crack AES as previously thought, suggested Kocher, and that makes the report a significant finding.\nUsers are already paranoid over attacks that they don't understand, he noted, nd while attackers do improve over time, nobody actually breaks anything, he said.\n\"There is plenty of software bugs for attackers to use to bypass breaking the keys. That's what keeps me awake at night, not the algorithms,\" said Kocher.\n© 2009 ECT News Network. All rights reserved.\n© 2009 BetaNews.com. All rights reserved.", "label": 1}
{"text": "A standard protection method that most businesses (both large and small) utilize to protect their establishment from theft is a common burglar alarm. Given this fact, it is amazing how many of these same businesses install little if any protection to guard their networks from attack and theft of valuable company information. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essentially a burglar alarm system for your network. It enables you to monitor your network for intrusive activity. When intrusive activity occurs, your IDS generates an alarm to let you know that your network is possibly under attack. Like regular burglar alarms, however, your IDS can generate \"false positives\" or \"false alarms\".\nA false positive occurs when your IDS generates an alarm from normal user activity. If your IDS generates too many false positives, then you will lose confidence in the capability of your IDS to protect your network. If you have a burglar alarm that continually goes off incorrectly, the police will become conditioned to the fact that your establishment is prone to false alarms. During an actual break-in, the police may not respond as quickly, thinking that the alarm is just another false alarm. Therefore, it is crucial that you configure your IDS to minimize the number of false positives that it generates.\nYou IDS may also experience false negatives. In this situation, an attack occurs against your network, and your IDS fails to alarm even though it is designed to detect such an attack. Your IDS should almost never generate false negatives. In fact, it is preferable for your IDS to actually generate more false positives rather than generating any false negatives.\nTo protect your network, your IDS must generate alarms when it detects intrusive activity on your network. Different IDSs trigger alarms based on different types of network activity. The two most common triggering mechanisms are the following:\n- Anomaly detection\n- Misuse detection\nBesides implementing a triggering mechanism, your IDS must somehow watch for intrusive activity at specific points within your network. Monitoring intrusive activity normally occurs at the following two locations:\nFinally, many intrusion detection systems incorporate multiple features into a single system. These systems are known as hybrid systems.\nWith anomaly detection, you need to create a profile for each user group on your system. These profiles can be built automatically or created manually. How the profiles are created is not important as long as the profiles accurately define the characteristics for each user group or user on your network. These profiles are then used as a baseline to define normal user activity. If any network activity deviates too far from this baseline, then the activity generates an alarm. Because this type of IDS is designed around user profiles, it is also sometimes known as profile-based detection.\nAnomaly detection systems offer several benefits. First, they can detect insider attacks or account theft very easily. If a real user or someone using a stolen account starts performing actions that are outside the normal user-profile, it generates an alarm. Second, because the system is based on customized profiles, it is very difficult for an attacker to know with certainty what activity he can do without setting off an alarm. Probably the largest benefit, however, is that intrusive activity is not based on specific traffic that represents known intrusive activity (as in a signature-based IDS). An anomaly detection system can potentially detect an attack the first time it is used. The intrusive activity generates an alarm because it deviates from normal activity, not because someone configured the system to look for a specific stream of traffic.\nLike every IDS, anomaly detection systems also suffer from several drawbacks. The first obvious drawback is that the system must be trained to create the appropriate user profiles. During the training period to define what normal traffic looks like on your network, the network is not protected from attack. Just defining \"normal\" is a challenge in itself. Maintenance of the profiles can also become time-consuming. Nevertheless, the biggest drawback to anomaly detection is probably the complexity of the system and the difficulty of associating an alarm with the specific event that triggered the alarm. Furthermore, you have no guarantee that a specific attack will even generate an alarm. If the intrusive activity is too close to normal user activity, then the attack will go unnoticed. It is also difficult for you to know which attacks will set off alarms unless you actually test the attacks against your network using various user-profiles.\nThe second major category of IDS triggering is known as misuse detection. Misuse detection is also sometimes referred to as signature-based detection because alarms are generated based on specific attack signatures. These attack signatures encompass specific traffic or activity that is based on known intrusive activity.\nMisuse detection provides various benefits. One of the first benefits is that the signature definitions are modeled on known intrusive activity. Furthermore, the user can examine the signature database, and quickly determine which intrusive activity the misuse detection system is programmed to alert on. Another benefit is that the misuse detection system begins protecting your network immediately upon installation. One final benefit is that the system is easy to understand. When an alarm fires, the user can relate this directly to a specific type of activity occurring on the network.\nAlong with the numerous benefits, misuse detection systems also have their share of drawbacks. One of the biggest problems is maintaining state information for signatures in which the intrusive activity encompasses multiple discrete events (that is, the complete attack signature occurs in multiple packets on the network). Another drawback is that your misuse detection system must have a signature defined for all of the possible attacks that an attacker may launch against your network. This leads to the necessity for frequent signature updates to keep the signature database of your misuse detection system up-to-date. One final problem with misuse detection systems is that someone may set up the misuse detection system in their lab and intentionally try to find ways to launch attacks that bypass detection by the misuse detection system.", "label": 1}

{"text": "San Franciscans are in the dark about the city's plans for surveillance streetlights\nIn the Netherlands city of Eindhoven, the streetlights lining a central commercial strip will glow red if a storm is coming. It's a subtle cue that harkens back to an old phrase about a red sky warning mariners that bad weather is on the way. The automated color change is possible because satellite weather data flows over a network to tiny processors installed inside the lampposts, which are linked by an integrated wireless system.\nLighting hues reflecting atmospheric changes are only the beginning of myriad functions these so-called \"smart streetlights\" can perform. Each light has something akin to a smartphone embedded inside of it, and the interconnected network of lights can be controlled by a central command center.\nSince they have built-in flexibility for multiple adaptations, the systems can be programmed to serve a wide variety of purposes. Aside from merely illuminating public space, possible uses could include street surveillance with tiny cameras, monitoring pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or issuing emergency broadcasts via internal speaker systems.\nThe smart streetlights aren't just streetlights — they're data collection devices that have the potential to track anything from pedestrian movements to vehicle license plate numbers. And, through a curious process distinctly lacking in transparency, these spylights are on their way to San Francisco.\nOn Minna between Fourth and Sixth streets in downtown San Francisco, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has installed a pilot project to test 14 streetlights that are connected by a wireless control system. The city agency plans to gauge how well this system can remotely read city-owned electric meters, wirelessly transmit data from tiny traffic cameras owned by the Municipal Transportation Agency, and transmit data from traffic signals.\nThe pilot grew out of San Francisco's participation in an international program called the Living Labs Global Award, an annual contest that pairs technology vendors with officials representing 22 cities from around the world. At a May 2012 LLGA awards summit in Rio de Janeiro, far outside the scope of the city's normal bidding processes, a Swiss company called Paradox Engineering won the right to start testing the high-tech lights in San Francisco. Within six months, Paradox Engineering and the SFPUC had the Minna streetlights test up and running.\nMeanwhile, the city has issued a separate Request for Proposals for a similar pilot, which will test out \"adaptive lighting\" that can be dimmed or brightened in response to sensors that register pedestrian activity or traffic volume. The city is negotiating contracts with five firms that will test out this technology in three different locations, according to Mary Tienken, Project Manager for LED Streetlight Conversion Project for the SFPUC.\nUnder the program, five vendors will be chosen to demonstrate their wireless streetlights on 18 city-owned lights at three test sites: Washington Street between Lyon and Maple streets; Irving Street between 9th and 19th avenues; and Pine Street between Front and Stockton streets.\nLED streetlights are energy-efficient and could yield big savings — but the lights do far more than shine. The RFP indicates that \"future needs for the secure wireless transmission of data throughout the city\" could include traffic monitoring, street surveillance, gunshot monitoring and street parking monitoring devices.\nMost Commented On\n- The writing is on the wall (on the waterfront, that is) - May 24, 2013\n- Street music - May 23, 2013\n- Okay.

Rogue antivirus are fake antivirus programs, which exploit your fear of malware. They display virus alerts, also known as “scareware”, claiming malware has been detected on your computer. The security alerts are professional looking pop-ups and ads and often have exactly the same design as Windows pop-ups. When you click on it, you’re advised to buy a certain anti virus protection software.\nThis software will not remove the virus, but instead allow malware in - often floods of annoying pop-up windows and aggressive advertising. Buying rogue antivirus can also compromise your credit card security and lead to identity theft.\nIf you ever receive a virus alert form an unknown source, simply ignore it. If you have an internet security program like BullGuard Internet Security you are already protected – and you can always contact the BullGuard online support team with any doubts.\nBeware of fake news stories\nRogue/Scareware creators are constantly coming up with new ways to deceive you into downloading their malware. One trick is to use Black Hat SEO (unethical search engine optimization techniques) to generate fake news stories containing scareware top search results.\nPeople searching for news on the death of Polish President Lech Kaczyinsky in the spring of 2010 were led to websites containing scareware instead. Also, searches like “jack johnson tour dates usa 2010”, “mine rescue teams” and “kristen stewart Budapest” led to fake news sites containing scareware. The internet criminals keep themselves well informed on current events and exploit the public’s interest for the news, as they constantly launch scareware sites with the most effective keywords referring to current news stories.\nSo how should you search for news and at the same time avoid scareware? Go directly to newspaper sites and search for news using the site’s search function. If you choose to “google” current events and you receive a virus alert when entering the alleged news site, don’t respond and leave the site immediately.\nIn the spring of 2010, researchers from Google released a new study on rogue antivirus. Over the course of 13 months the researchers went through 240 million web pages and found that 11,000 of them were involved in distributing rogue internet security software. They also found that rogue antiviruses account for 15% of all malware on the internet, but have recently decreased in popularity, allowing downloader Trojans to take the first place.\nYou can see a comparison between January 2010 and April 2010 in the graph below:\nRead more about the Google rise of fake anti-virus research.\nTry a 60 day free trial of BullGuard Internet Security with 24/7 online support.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Twitter is slowly turning on automatic encryption on its website, a move following other major providers of web-based services to thwart account hijacking over wireless networks.\nTwitter has offered an option for users to turn on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, but said on Tuesday that it will turn the feature on by default for some users. It did not indicate when the option would be turned on by default for all users.\nSSL encryption, indicted by \"https\" in the URL bar and sometimes a padlock in the browser window, is an encryption protocol used to protect communication between a client and a server. It is important to use because unencrypted information passed over wireless networks can be intercepted.\nMany websites encrypt a person's login and password but will stop encrypting further data that is transmitted. A reason for not using SSL throughout a session is that it can occasionally slow interaction between the user and website.\nLast year, a freelance web application developer named Eric Butler released Firesheep, an add-on for Firefox that snatches cookies transmitted on unencrypted networks. Web sites drop a cookie, or a small data file, into a person's Web browser while they are logged into a session. Cookies are also used to \"remember\" people and keep them logged into the website.\nFiresheep used an technique that was well-known but made it very easy for novice hackers to grab cookies and immediately log into a website as another person with just two clicks, known as session hijacking. If Firesheep detected someone logging into say, Facebook, on an open wireless network it would display their photo and name, which could be clicked in Firesheep, hijacking the person's account.\nSSL would thwart such an attack since the cookie would encrypted. Other websites have started to step up their security as well. Facebook allows people to turn on SSL for a person's entire session in the \"Account Settings\" under \"Security.\" In January 2010, Google turned on SSL for everyone using Gmail by default.\nSend news tips and comments to email@example.com", "label": 1}
{"text": "Steven Hofmeyr, 35\nDevised software that roots out security threats to a networks operating system\nWhen investors backed Sana Security in San Mateo, CA, they took out $1 million in insurance on chief scientist Steven Hofmeyr, because his ideas about computer network security were their most valuable asset. Sana Security (“sana” is Esperanto for healthy) treats intranets and local-area networks much the way the human immune system treats the body: when abnormal activity occurs, Sana software recognizes the problem, isolates and analyzes it, then attempts to fight it off. Network security typically relies on human administrators who often arrive too late to stop intrusions (in January the Slammer virus reportedly infected 75,000 machines within 10 minutes). Other tools, such as software updates, arrive after the fact and can be expensive. Sana’s Primary Response product resides on each computer within a network and continuously interrogates vulnerable applications, such as e-mail programs, at the operating-system level.

{"text": "The latest research from Websense Security Labs paints a dreary but familiar picture of the state of online security threats. Echoing the bad news of other such recent reports, it seems the vast majority of the Web consists of malware and spam. Worse yet, even legitimate, well-known sites are being used to pump malware, SEO poisoning, or phishing attacks.\nWebsense uses a global network of systems to scan and analyze over 40 billion websites every hour, tracking malware and other unwanted content. The results for the latter half of 2009 show a 225 percent increase in malicious websites. Worse, 71 percent of websites found to contain some malicious code were in fact legitimate websites that had been compromised in some way.\nOne way that hackers are infiltrating the Web is by \"SEO poisoning,\" or using SEO techniques to pump up the ranking of malicious websites in search results to make them appear legitimate. On average, 14 percent of top search results for a given \"hot\" topic on Google led to a malicious website.\nThis method has proven fairly successful, since it can easily adapt to changing search trends and get around detection. Malicious websites looking to cash in on \"Google Wave invites\" can use botnets to artificially inflate search rankings. As soon as the sites are discovered and filtered from search results, botnets can be instructed to move on to the next hot topic, such as \"MTV VMA awards\" or \"Brittany Murphy death.\"\nStill, hackers and spammers are increasingly going after legitimate websites, which already appear in top search results and often are considered \"safe\" or \"trusted\" by security filters. The top 100 most-visited websites represent the vast majority of Web traffic, and consist mainly of social networking and search sites. Malware is injected via \"user-generated content,\" such as news items, posted links, and comments.\nSpotting a spam comment used to be quite easy, but separating the wheat from the chaff is becoming more and more difficult. Websense analysis revealed that 95 percent of all user-generated content is spam, malware, or both. (The notion that the Internet could be the great equalizer turned out to be true after all; unfortunately, it's mostly making suckers out of all of us.)\nAttacks are also becoming more and more sophisticated and targeted. E-mail is still largely spam, about 85 percent, but 81 percent also contains links to malicious websites. In the second half of 2009, hackers used exploits in Internet Explorer, Outlook Web Access, and hacked Hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo accounts to send ever-more personalized e-mails, which can fool the receiver into believing the e-mail came from a legitimate source. These e-mails will then link back directly to malware or phishing sites, or indirectly by linking to content on a legitimate site that leads to a malicious website.\nSavvy users who maintain constant vigilance may not have too much trouble spotting attempts to hijack legitimate content. Ultimately, however, the increases in malicious websites or content that appear to be legitimate simply make it harder and harder for the average person to know who, or what, to trust online. And when just five percent of user-generated content isn't spam or malware, many may question the utility of bothering to discern a difference.", "label": 1}
{"text": "It’s a good idea to change or rotate your passwords every few months to lessen the chance of a hacker stealing them. And what better time to do it, then now, at the beginning of a new season. Here are some tips for creating strong passwords and safeguarding them.\nOutsmart hackers with long, strong passwords. Passwords should be at least eight characters and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. To come up with a strong password, you may want to take a well-known phrase like “Don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill,” and use the first letter of each word. So in this example, your password would be dmamooamh. Then, to make it stronger, you could use d2Mamooamh!\nTry a password-strength checker. If you want to see how strong your password is you may want to try a free password-strength checker. But don’t rely on this type of software too much because it doesn’t test whether a password has easily identifiable information such as your birthday or mother’s maiden name.\nHave a handful of passwords. Security experts recommend having four or five passwords. It’s important to have a separate password for your email account because most sites have a “forgot my password’’ tab that can be figured out by many hackers. It’s also a good idea to have separate passwords for social media sites, financial sites – like your bank accounts – and shopping sites. Some people also have a password for sites they don’t trust or don’t use often.\nBut how can you remember all of those passwords? If you have trouble remembering four or five passwords, you could use a password manager. This software, which is often free, lets you create a master password, which leads you to your other passwords. Or you could go the low-tech way, and write down all of your passwords and keep them in a safe place until you have them memorized. Then throw them away.\nKeep anti-virus and anti-spyware software up-to-date. Despite your best efforts, a thief could still steal your password with malware that tracks your keystrokes. The best way to avoid this is to keep your anti-virus and anti-spyware software updated to block malware from infecting your computer. It’s also wise to avoid downloading files from unknown websites and email senders.", "label": 1}
{"text": "As a business grows, it might expand to multiple shops or offices across the country and around the world. To keep things running efficiently, the people working in those locations need a fast, secure and reliable way to share information across computer networks. In addition, traveling employees like salespeople need an equally secure and reliable way to connect to their business's computer network from remote locations.\nOne popular technology to accomplish these goals is a VPN (virtual private network). A VPN is a private network that uses a public network (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users together. The VPN uses \"virtual\" connections routed through the Internet from the business's private network to the remote site or employee. By using a VPN, businesses ensure security -- anyone intercepting the encrypted data can't read it.\nVPN was not the first technology to make remote connections. Several years ago, the most common way to connect computers between multiple offices was by using a leased line. Leased lines, such as ISDN (integrated services digital network, 128 Kbps), are private network connections that a telecommunications company could lease to its customers. Leased lines provided a company with a way to expand its private network beyond its immediate geographic area. These connections form a single wide-area network (WAN) for the business. Though leased lines are reliable and secure, the leases are expensive, with costs rising as the distance between offices increases.\nToday, the Internet is more accessible than ever before, and Internet service providers (ISPs) continue to develop faster and more reliable services at lower costs than leased lines. To take advantage of this, most businesses have replaced leased lines with new technologies that use Internet connections without sacrificing performance and security. Businesses started by establishing intranets, which are private internal networks designed for use only by company employees. Intranets enabled distant colleagues to work together through technologies such as desktop sharing. By adding a VPN, a business can extend all its intranet's resources to employees working from remote offices or their homes.\nThis article describes VPN components, technologies, tunneling and security. First, let's explore an analogy that describes how a VPN compares to other networking options.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cloud-based applications are the future. Soon, cloud apps that are accessed using any device with a Web browser and Internet access will replace traditional legacy apps. But with so many applications coming from different providers, how will end users' personal information transfer from one cloud app to another?\nIn the post-PC era, computing is about the user rather than the device. What cloud applications know about users and how that knowledge is transmitted is a vital part. For example, I shouldn't have to enter my personal information every time I sign up for a different application; if I change my address or cell phone number in one application, all cloud apps should recognize that change. In addition, personal preferences, such as how the date appears, should override device settings.\nAs we move from a PC-centric world to a person-centric world, there should be a centralized record of a user's identity in the cloud -- similar to a Windows user roaming profile. This record wouldn't reside in a single database for everyone, although I'm sure Google, Facebook and Microsoft would each want access to that if it existed. Instead, users subscribe to a preferred provider with a standard for accessing personal information. In this case, when an end user signs up for a cloud application, the app would query his or her information from the cloud provider -- rather than offer a multipage signup form.\nIn the post-PC era, computing is about the user rather than the device.\nGoogle, Facebook and Microsoft already have some of my personal information, and they make it available across their estates of cloud services. To be truly useful, users' information should be available across different companies' estates. If Google is where I primarily store data, then Microsoft and Facebook should also have access to that data, along with DropBox, Salesforce and every other cloud application to which I subscribe.\nOnce users have a central record of personal preferences and information, then we should see extensions to other types of information. The profile could include citizenship information as well as driver's license and organ donor status, for example. Social media accounts could be set up so users can follow any cloud application they sign into.\nHaving a single authoritative record for details about users, in addition to simplifying access for end users, would make information management simpler. In New Zealand, for example, we have different privacy and disclosure laws from other jurisdictions; these differences should be taken into account. Employers should be able to access some information, and the government should be able to access a separate set of data. We also need some serious security controls here to prevent unintended disclosure.\nBut cloud providers seem to be opposed to what users want from cloud-based applications; Amazon Web Services and other major cloud service providers don't see value in facilitating user mobility among cloud services. And end users are unlikely to pay for a service unless it works across all cloud applications they want to access. For now, users are left with \"islands\" of identity with each of the main cloud service providers -- and a form-filling application on their laptops to take the drudgery out of those long signup pages.\nAbout the author\nAlastair Cooke is a freelance trainer, consultant and blogger specializing in server and desktop virtualization.

Someone can literally create the perfect credit scenario and then destroy it,\" says Levin.\nHe says young people also make it easy by oversharing on social networking sites and by constantly staying connected via laptops or smartphones.\n\"To you, your smartphone is a communication device. To an identity thief, your smartphone is a collection and data storage device, just like your computer,\" says Levin. \"So you need to treat it with the same respect that you treat your computer.\"\nMake sure all children's devices are password-protected and equipped with anti-virus software.\nHe also recommends re-enforcing a lesson from childhood: don't talk to strangers, be it replying to phishing emails or simply answering Facebook quizzes.

{"text": "IT Management and Support\nIT: Deploying virtual servers\nProblem: Meeting the demand for servers to support the huge growth in IT services in a 30 year old machine room where power and cooling were at their limit. Several years ago, Information Technology reached the point where we could only install a new server in the machine room if we removed one.\nChange: The solution was server virtualization, which creates the environment where multiple virtual servers can operate effectively on a single physical server. Using this technology, Information Technology now operates 210 virtual servers on 38 physical machines.\nImpact: Two obvious, but hard to quantify, savings include electricity and cooling. Other benefits include faster deployment of servers, easier recovery from a server failure, and greater service redundancy. Cost avoidance for not purchasing over 200 physical machines is well over $500,000. Given that the existing machine room is at capacity, there is no doubt William & Mary would have had to forgo some IT services without virtualization.\nIT: Replace aging technologies\nProblem: Technology is constantly changing thereby making some existing IT services obsolete while increasing demand on IT for implementing new technologies. Doing away or replacing obsolete technologies has allowed IT to implement new and improved services as well as meet required budget cuts.\n(A) Removed all in-room residence hall student land lines and made phone service optional.\nImpact: Over the past several years students have moved almost exclusively to using cellular phones for voice communication. IT has removed over 2000 phones from residence halls which has simultaneously increased capacity on the existing system while decreasing required maintenance. Without this change, we would not have had the capacity to support the new School of Business or School of Education buildings. Additionally, removing these phones significantly reduced the startup costs of the College’s new phone system.\n(B) With the implementation of College’s ERP system (Banner) complete, we were able to phase out use of the legacy mainframe.\nImpact: Annual savings of $500,000 in maintenance costs.\n(C) Renegotiated the College’s bulk cable TV contract and eliminated the College Movie Channel.\nImpact: With many alternative media services available via the Internet, we were able to reduce these services with little or no impact to students at an annual savings of $75,000.\n(D) Moving to Microsoft Exchange email and calendaring solution for faculty/staff. Exchange replaces two separate IT services with one integrated service considered to be the industry standard.\nImpact: Simplifies support and allows standardized scheduling to be implemented across the entire university including those graduate schools with exiting systems. This allowed us to achieve savings in calendar licensing from Oracle at $7,000 per annum. Since we already own the licensing for exchange we avoided additional email licensing costs to another vendor.\n(E) Distribute desktop software via the network rather than by CD or DVD. This distribution method created an immediate on-demand service for faculty, staff and students to acquire software without visiting the Technology Support Center or waiting on IT staff to complete desk side visits.\nImpact: Improves licensing accountability and security.\nTotal Impact: Increased service at an annual saving of over $582,000 per year.", "label": 1}

CCIPS prevents, investigates, and prosecutes computer crimes by working with other government agencies, the private sector, academic institutions, and foreign counterparts.\n- Digital Millennium Copyright Act\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998. The basic purpose of the DMCA is to amend Title 17 of the United States Code and to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty and Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which were designed to update world copyright laws to deal with the new technology.\n- Economic Espionage Act (EEA)\nIn addition to laws specifically tailored to deal with computer crimes, traditional laws can also be used to prosecute crimes involving computers. For example the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) was passed in 1996 and was created in order to put a stop to trade secret misappropriation.\n- Electronic Communications Privacy Act\nPassed in 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law, the Act made it illegal to intercept stored or transmitted electronic communication without authorization.\n- FBI - Cyber Crime Division\nThe FBI's cyber mission is four-fold: first and foremost, to stop those behind the most serious computer intrusions and the spread of malicious code; second, to identify and thwart online sexual predators who use the Internet to meet and exploit children and to produce, possess, or share child pornography; third, to counteract operations that target U.S. intellectual property, endangering our national security and competitiveness; and fourth, to dismantle national and transnational organized criminal enterprises engaging in Internet fraud. Pursuant to the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace signed by the President, the Department of Justice and the FBI lead the national effort to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.\n- Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers\nSection 1030(a)(1) makes it illegal to access a computer without authorization or in excess of one’s authorization and obtain information about national defense, foreign relations, or restricted data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 19549, which covers all data concerning design, manufacture or utilization of atomic weapons and production of nuclear material. It is worth noting that section 1030(a)(1) requires proof that the individual knowingly accessed the computer without authority or in excess of authorization for the purpose of obtaining classified or protected information. Section 1030(a)(1) criminalizes the use of a computer to gain access to the information, not the unauthorized possession of it or its transmission.\n- Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act\nFOISA attempts to tackle the problem of criminals registering online domains under false identification, it includes a provision that would increase jail times for people who provide false contact information to a domain name registrar and then use that domain to commit copyright and trademark infringement crimes.\n- Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2008\nTo establish broadband policy and direct the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a proceeding and public broadband summits to assess competition, consumer protection, and consumer choice issues relating to broadband Internet access services, and for other purposes.\n- National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996\nThe National Information Infrastructure Act (NIIA) was passed in 1996 to expand the CFAA to encompass unauthorized access to a protected computer in excess of the parties’ authorization.\n- The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, first enacted in 1984 and revised in 1994, makes it certain activities designed to access a \"federal interest computer\" illegal. These activities may range from knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to the transmission of a harmful component of a program, information, code, or command. A federal interest computer includes a computer used by a financial institution, used by the United States Government, or one of two or more computers used in committing the offense, not all of which are located in the same State. The Legal Institute provides Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which encompasses the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\nComputer Related Crimes Law\n- CA Global Security Advisor - Viruses, Spyware, Malware and Worms\nCA's Global Security Advisor is the place to check for current information on global threats that is researched and published via a network of rapid response centers around the world delivering: Comprehensive validated virus, spyware and vulnerability databases Clean-up utilities, detection signatures files and remediation instructions Valuable documentation on implementing complete threat protection and security management solutions.\n- CAN-SPAM Act\nDespite its name, the CAN-SPAM Act doesn’t apply just to bulk email. It covers all commercial messages, which the law defines as “any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service,” including email that promotes content on commercial websites. The law makes no exception for business-to-business email. That means all email – for example, a message to former customers announcing a new product line – must comply with the law.\n- Computer Crime Research Center - Computer Piracy\nComputer piracy is reproduction, distribution and use of software without permission of the owner of copyright. Kinds of illegal software use that can be qualified as copyright violation: - selling of computer facilities with illegally installed software; - replication and distribution of software copies on information carriers without permission of the copyright owner; - illegal distribution of software through communication networks (Internet, e-mail, etc.); - illegal use of software by the user.\n- Computer Hacking Laws\nThe news said that another person had their identity stolen. It happened again. You might even know of someone that had it happen to them. We often hear of percentages - and they are surprisingly high. Enforcement is taking place, but we have to wonder if computer hacking laws are really having any effect against cyber hacking. This article will show what is being done against cyber crime.\n- Denial-of-Service Attacks\nIn a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing information or services. By targeting your computer and its network connection, or the computers and network of the sites you are trying to use, an attacker may be able to prevent you from accessing email, web sites, online accounts (banking, etc.), or other services that rely on the affected computer. The most common and obvious type of DoS attack occurs when an attacker \"floods\" a network with information. When you type a URL for a particular web site into your browser, you are sending a request to that site's computer server to view the page. The server can only process a certain number of requests at once, so if an attacker overloads the server with requests, it can't process your request. This is a \"denial of service\" because you can't access that site.\n- Internet Investment Scams - SEC\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which receives about 300 complaints a day concerning online scams, devotes one-fourth of its enforcement staff to computer-related offenses.\n- Internet Scam and Hoaxes\nEmail hoaxes spread misinformation, waste bandwidth, and lessen the effectiveness of email as a communication medium. Hoax-Slayer helps stop the continued circulation of these hoaxes by publishing information about them. Hoax-Slayer allows Internet users to check the veracity of a large number of common email hoaxes. Information about new hoaxes is added on a regular basis.\n- Internet Stalking and Harassment\nAlthough no universally accepted definition exists, cyber stalking is generally defined as the use of the Internet, e-mail or other electronic communications device to stalk or harass a person. .\n- National Consumers League - Online and Internet Fraud\nOur mission is to give consumers the information they need to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing and Internet fraud and to help them get their complaints to law enforcement agencies quickly and easily.\n- Online Safety - Phishing\nPhishing e-mail messages are designed to steal your identity. They ask for personal data, or direct you to Web sites or phone numbers to call where they ask you to provide personal data.\nComputer Crime Law - International\nThe tremendous growth in the use of information technology and Internet has brought us great convenience. However, it also creates a great potential for abuse by criminals. With the cross-border, open-platform, highly-interconnected nature of this virtual dimension, the impacts of cyber crimes are far-reaching, and would require integral effort from all parties involved in order to effectively combat cyber crimes.\n- Integrated Technological Crime Unit - Computer Crimes Legislation - RCMP\nCanada was one of the first countries to enact criminal laws in the area of computer crime and continues to adjust to ever-evolving technologies.\nOrganizations Related to Computer Crime Law\n- Australian High Tech Crime Centre (AHTCC)\nAs agreed by the AHTCC Board of Management, the four core functions of the AHTCC included: 1. Policy advocacy; 2. Strategic intelligence support; 3. Crime prevention and education; and 4. Capability development. In June 2007, the AHTCC Board of Management agreed that the AHTCC would transfer from being a nationally-governed centre to becoming a dedicated AFP portfolio, retaining its national focus. The transfer became effective 1 October 2007, and a new High Tech Crime Operations (HTCO) portfolio was officially launched on 1 March 2008.\n- Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT)\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit public policy organization dedicated to promoting the democratic potential of today's open, decentralized global Internet. Our mission is to conceptualize, develop, and implement public policies that will keep the Internet open, innovative and free.\nThe CERT® Program is part of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a federally funded research and development center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Following the Morris worm incident, which brought 10 percent of internet systems to a halt in November 1988, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) charged the SEI with setting up a center to coordinate communication among experts during security emergencies and to help prevent future incidents. This center was named the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC).\n- Computer Crime Research Center\nThe Computer Crime Research Center was created in 2001 to conduct research in legal criminal and criminological problems of cybercrime with the purpose to render scientific and methodical aid, consulting. We accumulate experience and perform analysis of results of scientific practical research in counteracting and preventing computer crimes. We collaborate with The Security Engineering Research Center (SERC), Hannam University (Korea), The Zaporizhzhya National University \"ZNU\" (Zaporozhye, Ukraine) and other universities, institutes and research centers.\n- Forum of Incidence Response and Security Teams\nFIRST is the premier organization and recognized global leader in incident response. Membership in FIRST enables incident response teams to more effectively respond to security incidents reactive as well as proactive. FIRST brings together a variety of computer security incident response teams from government, commercial, and educational organizations. FIRST aims to foster cooperation and coordination in incident prevention, to stimulate rapid reaction to incidents, and to promote information sharing among members and the community at large.\n- G8 (Group of 8) and the G8's Subgroup on High-Tech Crime\nOn May 10-11, 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge met in Washington, DC with the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs from the G8 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and with the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs. There were four primary topics of discussion: prevention of terrorism and serious criminal acts; border and transportation security; combating cybercrime and enhancing cyber-investigations; and fighting foreign official corruption and recovering stolen national assets.\n- High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA)\nThe High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA) is designed to encourage, promote, aid and effect the voluntary interchange of data, information, experience, ideas and knowledge about methods, processes, and techniques relating to investigations and security in advanced technologies among its membership.\n- Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). IC3's mission is to serve as a vehicle to receive, develop, and refer criminal complaints regarding the rapidly expanding arena of cyber crime. The IC3 gives the victims of cyber crime a convenient and easy-to-use reporting mechanism that alerts authorities of suspected criminal or civil violations. For law enforcement and regulatory agencies at the federal, state, local and international level, IC3 provides a central referral mechanism for complaints involving Internet related crimes\n- Internet Fraud Watch (IFW)\nThe Internet offers a global marketplace for consumers and businesses. But crooks also recognize the potentials of cyberspace. The same scams that have been conducted by mail and phone can now be found on the World Wide Web and in email, and new cyberscams are emerging. It's sometimes hard to tell the difference between reputable online sellers and criminals who use the Internet to rob people. You can protect yourself by learning how to recognize the danger signs of fraud. If you are a victim or attempted victim of Internet fraud, it's important to report the scam quickly so that law enforcement agencies can shut the fraudulent operations down.\n- IT Security and Crime Prevention - Interpol\nInterpol has actively been involved for a number of years in combating Information Technology Crime. Rather than ‘re-inventing the wheel’, the Interpol General Secretariat has harnessed the expertise of its members in the field of Information Technology Crime (ITC) through the vehicle of a ‘working party’ or a group of experts. In this instance, the working party consists of the heads or experienced members of national computer crime units. These working parties have been designed to reflect regional expertise and exist in Europe, Asia, America and in Africa. All working parties are in different stages of development. It should be noted that the work done by the working parties is not Interpol’s only contribution to combating ITC, but it certainly represents the most noteworthy contribution to date.\nPublications Related to Computer Crime Law\n- DSP - Computer Crimes in Canada\nThe advent of the computer did not create a new crime, any more than than development of the automobile created a new form of larceny.

{"text": "In celebration of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Internet privacy provider Anonymizer wants everyone to know we’re not as safe as we think are when we’re online.\nThe company’s research found that a majority of us believe using firewall software (75 percent) or antivirus software (62 percent) is enough protection against identity theft online. That’s unfortunately not the case.\nHaving both a firewall and an antivirus program will help protect your data from stuff coming in, so you should use both. (We have recommendations for free antivirus software.) They also help guard against ID theft, but they only address half the equation: the incoming side.\nThose programs can’t do much about what you choose to send out through your computer, whether you do that by broadcasting information on a public network, instant messaging, sharing your files, or typing in your details on social networking sites, forums, or in e-mails.\nThere’s a lot of software out there you can pay for to protect some of these things. Anonymizer would have you pay $80 for a year of protection, and if you go visit their website right now, you’ll probably see your internet protocol (IP) address, city, and web browser listed – which might just scare you into buying.\nBut there are a lot of free solutions, too. While they’re not always simple to use, if they can save you money and help you keep your credit and privacy intact, they’re worth considering. We’ll start with the easiest ones first:\n- Use common sense. Watch what you say and where you say it. Don’t post information you might not want certain people to see unless you know it’s safely encrypted or otherwise protected. The Federal Trade Commission has some more basic Internet safety tips.\n- Update your software regularly. Because new viruses and security loopholes are always appearing, you need to keep updating. A friend of mine who works in an IT department likens this chore to brushing your teeth: If you don’t make it a habit, you might end up with problems, embarrassment, and a lot of pain. You don’t have to update three times a day, but weekly is good. Many programs can be set to update automatically, or at least to announce new versions. Use those settings and avoid both the hassle and the risk. Secunia provides a free tool that tells PC users what programs are out of date and helps you find the newest versions.\n- Use protected Wi-Fi connections. When you use a wireless connection, your data – possibly including your passwords – is literally floating around in the air, and anyone who knows how can eavesdrop on your computer. While places like Starbucks and Panera offer free Wi-Fi, it’s on an unsafe public network. The easiest way to protect yourself is to connect only to secure networks: they usually have a lock symbol next to them, and may mention WPA or WEP encryption. These networks garble up the data you’re transmitting so it won’t make sense to anyone trying to steal it. You usually can’t get on these networks without a password, though, so you won’t have access unless you’re supposed to. For more on secure networks, including how to secure your home wireless connection, check out this PC World article.\n- Make your instant messages instantly secure. This level of security isn’t practical for the average person, but if you’re concerned that someone’s snooping through your IMs, you can take a few steps. First, turn off any features that make logs of your conversations, then get your chat buddies to do the same. Second, look into software that encrypts your messages, like Off the Record. Privacy rights advocate The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), explains how to use OTR and other IM safety measures. If you’re a Mac user with the Adium client, it’s already built in. If you’re a PC user, you’re going to have to switch to a chat client like Pidgin, which connects to multiple popular IM networks including MSN, AIM, and Google.\n- Hide your IP address. If you’ve ever seen an advertisement pop up with deals or offers specifically for where you live, it’s because that site can see your IP address, which is a unique string of numbers assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. Hackers can also easily take advantage of a visible IP. How can you hide it? One solution endorsed by the EFF is The Onion Router, also known as Tor. You download the software (for either PC or Mac) and it works alongside Firefox and other programs to keep you hidden. There are a lot of ways your cover can slip, though, so read the instructions carefully. And there are downsides, too: The software can block things like YouTube videos from loading, for example. It’s up to you how safe you want to be – this is probably a little much for the average user.\nIt’s also worth pointing out that identity theft can happen regardless of how you use your computer.

{"text": "Depending on who you talk to, the advice could be very different. For years the advice was never to write down a password. And many systems didn’t even allow you to enter long passwords. Well, things have mostly changed now.\nThe advice from giants like Microsoft and Apple revolves around creating passwords from phrases. These techniques certainly work, but they can be a lot of effort. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos explains it very well in this video.\nBruce Schneier is one of the best on security, and his blog is well worth reading. He has articles about how often you should change passwords, And here’s a really usable approach to passwords. For a brainbox, he talks a lot of common sense. For example, he says:\n“If you can’t remember your passwords, write them down and put the paper in your wallet. But just write the sentence – or better yet – a hint that will help you remember your sentence. Or use a free program like Password Safe, which I designed to help people securely store all their passwords. Don’t feel this is a failure; most of us have far too many passwords to be able to remember them all.\nPasswords can still provide good authentication if used properly. The rise of alternate forms of authentication is more because people don’t use passwords securely, and less because they don’t work any more.”\nBut if you want really practical advice, the guys at Lifehacker have it all:\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has some good advice too.\nSocial engineering is on the increase, so be careful never to give out your password or any personal details to anyone who calls you or contacts you out of the blue. And certainly, don’t send security information by email. To hackers email is just like reading a postcard. Remember that it is really easy to make an email look as if it is coming from someone else. Watch out!\nThe PasswordGear Way\nWe have developed a new way of remembering passwords, because pretty much all user-generated passwords (even phrase-based) are sub-optimal in that they use predictable patterns and prefer some characters over others. So you start with a genuinely complex password, and use our clever Hookup System to remember it. You don’t need to use our iPhone App or software for it to work, but our tools definitely make things easier.\nAs other experts have mentioned, password managers are very good at storing many passwords. And we agree. We think more people should use password managers for the passwords they can’t remember. But of course, you will always need master passwords for these password managers, as well as the login to the computer itself. So we think the best possible approach incorporates both PasswordGear and other password managers.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Feb. 5, 2003 A team of network security experts in California has determined that the computer worm that attacked and hobbled the global Internet 11 days ago was the fastest computer worm ever recorded. In a technical paper released today, the experts report that the speed and nature of the Sapphire worm (also called Slammer) represent significant and worrisome milestones in the evolution of computer worms.\nComputer scientists at the University of California, San Diego and its San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), Eureka-based Silicon Defense, the University of California, Berkeley, and the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, found that the Sapphire worm doubled its numbers every 8.5 seconds during the explosive first minute of its attack. Within 10 minutes of debuting at 5:30 a.m. (UTC) Jan. 25 (9:30 p.m. PST, Jan. 24) the worm was observed to have infected more than 75,000 vulnerable hosts. Thousands of other hosts may also have been infected worldwide. The infected hosts spewed billions of copies of the worm into cyberspace, significantly slowing Internet traffic, and interfering with many business services that rely on the Internet.\n\"The Sapphire/Slammer worm represents a major new threat in computer worm technology, demonstrating that lightning-fast computer worms are not just a theoretical threat, but a reality,\" said Stuart Staniford, president and founder of Silicon Defense. \"Although this particular computer worm did not carry a malicious payload, it did a lot of harm by spreading so aggressively and blocking networks.\"\nThe Sapphire worm's software instructions, at 376 bytes, are about the length of the text in this paragraph, or only one-tenth the size of the Code Red worm, which spread through the Internet in July 2001. Sapphire's tiny size enabled it to reproduce rapidly and also fit into a type of network \"packet\" that was sent one-way to potential victims, an aggressive approach designed to infect all vulnerable machines rapidly and saturate the Internet's bandwidth, the experts said. In comparison, the Code Red worm spread much more slowly not only because it took longer to replicate, but also because infected machines sent a different type of message to potential victims that required them to wait for responses before subsequently attacking other vulnerable machines.\nThe Code Red worm ended up infecting 359,000 hosts, in contrast to the approximately 75,000 machines that Sapphire hit. However, Code Red took about 12 hours to do most of its dirty work, a snail's pace compared with the speedy Sapphire. The Code Red worm sent six copies of itself from each infected machine every second, in effect \"scanning\" the Internet randomly for vulnerable machines. In contrast, the speed with which the diminutive Sapphire worm copied itself and scanned the Internet for additional vulnerable hosts was limited only by the capacity of individual network connections.\n\"For example, the Sapphire worm infecting a computer with a one-megabit-per-second connection is capable of sending out 300 copies of itself each second,\" said Staniford. A single computer with a 100-megabit-per-second connection, found at many universities and large corporations, would allow the worm to scan 30,000 machines per second.\n\"The novel feature of this worm, compared to all the other worms we've studied, is its incredible speed: it flooded the Internet with copies of itself so aggressively that it basically clogged the available bandwidth and interfered with its own growth,\" said David Moore, an Internet researcher at SDSC's Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) and a Ph.D. candidate at UCSD under the direction of Stefan Savage, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. \"Although our colleagues at Silicon Defense and UC Berkeley had predicted the possibility of such high-speed worms on theoretical grounds, Sapphire is the first such incredibly fast worm to be released by computer hackers into the wild,\" said Moore.\nSapphire exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL servers used for database management, and MSDE 2000, a mini version of SQL for desktop use. Although Microsoft had made a patch available, many machines did not have the patch installed when Sapphire struck. Fortunately, even the successfully attacked machines were only temporarily out of service.\n\"Sapphire's greatest harm was caused by collateral damage--a denial of legitimate service by taking database servers out of operation and overloading networks,\" said Colleen Shannon, a CAIDA researcher. \"At Sapphire's peak, it was scanning 55 million hosts per second, causing a computer version of freeway gridlock when all the available lanes are bumper-to-bumper.\" Many operators of infected computers shut down their machines, disconnected them from the Internet, installed the Microsoft patch, and turned them back on with few, if any, ill effects.\nThe team in California investigating the attack relied on data gathered by an array of Internet \"telescopes\" strategically placed at network junctions around the globe. These devices sampled billions of information-containing \"packets\" analogous to the way telescopes gather photons.\nWith the Internet telescopes, the team found that nearly 43 percent of the machines that became infected are located in the United States, almost 12 percent are in South Korea, and more than 6 percent are in China.\nDespite the worm's success in wreaking temporary havoc, the technical report analyzing Sapphire states that the worm's designers made several \"mistakes\" that significantly reduced the worm's distribution capability.\nFor example, the worm combined high-speed replication with a commonly used random number generator to send messages to every vulnerable server connected to the Internet. This so-called scanning behavior is much like a burglar randomly rattling doorknobs, looking for one that isn't locked. However, the authors made several mistakes in adapting the random number generator. Had not there been enough correct instructions to compensate for the mistakes, the errors would have prevented Sapphire from reaching large portions of the Internet.\nThe analysis of the worm revealed no intent to harm its infected hosts. \"If the authors of Sapphire had desired, they could have made a slightly larger version that could have erased the hard drives of infected machines,\" said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. \"Thankfully, that didn't occur.\"\nThe full report is available at: http://www.caida.org/analysis/security/sapphire/\nThe authors of the report are:\nDavid Moore, CAIDA and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UCSD\nVern Paxson, the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nStefan Savage, Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UCSD\nColleen Shannon, CAIDA\nStuart Staniford, Silicon Defense\nNicholas Weaver, Silicon Defense and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at UC Berkeley\nFor more information about the institutions and organizations involved in the report, go to the San Diego Supercomputer Center (http://www.sdsc.edu), CAIDA (http://www.caida.org), the UCSD Computer Science and Engineering Department (http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/), Silicon Defense (http://www.silicondefense.com/), the International Computer Science Institute (http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/), and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at UC Berkeley (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/).\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

{"text": "Fri March 9, 2012\nDrones Over America: What Can They See?\nUnmanned aircraft systems, or drones, have long played a role in military operations. But imagine thousands of drones flying over U.S. skies — something we may see in just a few years. In February, President Obama signed an aviation bill requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to make plans to integrate drones into American airspace.\nOn Monday's Fresh Air, John Villasenor, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA, explains what these drones will be able to see and how they work. He also talks about the privacy and national security concerns raised by using drones for surveillance purposes.\nVillasenor tells Dave Davies that drones, which are currently in use over the U.S. border with Mexico, have an endless list of non-military uses, from providing overhead surveillance for police departments to spotting wildfires and monitoring illegal border crossings.\nDrones could also be used commercially by real estate firms to get overhead images of a property, by surveyors and cinematographers, and even by paparazzi trying to fly over celebrity homes, says Villasenor.\n\"That is going to be certainly some of the tests of what the limits are going to be provided by [paparazzi],\" he says. \"The paparazzi will want to use drones if they can and obviously that's going to raise some very significant questions.\"\nOne question about drone usage obviously concerns privacy. In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that police officers who used a small single-engine airplane to spot hidden marijuana plants in someone's backyard in California did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they were in \"public navigable airspace in a physically non-intrusive manner.\"\n\"Now if you take that ruling and apply it to a world in which there are hundreds or thousands of drones, that obviously gives rise to some very significant concerns,\" says Villasenor. \"If you interpret that ruling by itself, as things stand today, that would certainly suggest that people would have a fair amount of latitude to make observations using drones.\"\nBut several rulings involving what can be observed from outside a property to look inside a property may also apply, says Villasenor. He points to the 2001 case Kyllo v. United States, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the use of a thermal imaging device to monitor heat radiated from inside someone's home without a search warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\"There's a very interesting piece of language in that ruling that when you map it to drones is really interesting,\" he says. \"[It says] 'Where, as here, the government uses a device that is not in general public use to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a search.' One of the interesting phrases in that language is 'not in general public use.' If we fast forward two or three years from now, when drones are in public use, does that change the legal foundation for what you can and can't observe from the outside of a home that would have been previously unknowable without physical intrusion?\"\nOn types of drones\n\"There are drones that are powered by jet. There are drones that could literally fit in a backpack or the palm of a hand. There are drones that are basically like balloons that sit up there in the sky in one place and can observe enormous swaths of territory.\"\nOn drones that can stay in the air for weeks at a time\n\"These drones aren't flying at 400 mph. They're going very slowly and they have wings which are paper thin, which have solar panels which are mounted on the top and they also have batteries that store energy collected during the day so they can continue to turn the propellers and fly at night.\"\nOn whether drones can capture audio\n\"Drones generate some noise themselves and so I don't think a drone could sit 1,000 feet above and hear the conversation of two people sitting at an outside table at a coffee shop. I think it's mostly imagery and then to a smaller extent, wireless signals.\"\nOn drones helping traffic patterns\n\"Five years from now, you can probably imagine that in addition to having helicopters with people in them, you'll have drones above the ground taking pictures of those things.\"\nOn drones being used by terrorists\n\"Unfortunately I think that is a legitimate concern and honestly it keeps me up at night. I worry about that. It doesn't take too much imagination to understand that a drone is very hard to stop. It flies low and it isn't stopped by all of the infrastructure we have in place to make sure people don't go to the places they're not supposed to go to. Fences and walls and gates and barriers, it simply goes over those things. ... As these drones get cheaper, more prevalent, easier to get, attract less attention, it raises the risks that they will fall into the wrong hands and be used inappropriately.\"\nOn the FAA and privacy concerns\n\"The FAA, I would imagine, has more aviation lawyers than Fourth Amendment constitutional lawyers. To be fair to the FAA, their primary mission ... is to provide what they call 'the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world.' And frankly, I think they've done an extremely good job of that. So their concern, as they go through the steps of this aviation bill that was enacted on Feb. 14, 2012 is first and foremost to integrate drones into the airspace in a safe matter. And I think that is the right priority. In addition, of course, there are the privacy concerns. But I think it is going to be left to the broader government — obviously with the input of non-governmental groups — to address those.\"", "label": 1}
{"text": "The internet is an incredible development in technology that has revolutionized everything from personal communications to mass media, but it has a dark side as well.\nMost of us have had some experience with viruses or malicious software, and we know how devastating these programs can be.\nComputer failure and identity theft are just two of the many consequences that can result from irresponsible web surfing, so be sure to follow these tips for safe downloading online.\n- Keep a Firewall Up\nThe web can be a dangerous place, and maintaining your privacy is often difficult. Prying eyes are just behind every corner, and some downloads have the potential to expose your personal information to hackers. A firewall is your first line of defense. Firewalls keep network traffic secure by regulating what information can pass through–this is the most basic of tools to keep your downloads safe, so be sure that your firewall is up at all times.\n- Check File Extensions\nBe sure to look closely at file extensions before downloading any files. Files with the “.exe” extension are executable files that run a program function when they are opened, so only download these from trusted sources. Some malicious programs masquerade as other file types in order to trick users into thinking that they are safe. You might see, for example “DOCUMENT.doc.exe” which looks like a word processing document at first glance, but is likely to be a malicious trojan or virus.\n- Download Direct\nIf you are attempting to download a program, your safest bet is to download directly from the software provider. For media files such as music, video, e-books or other such things, download your files through only through trusted websites and services. Many users attempt to download files for free using file sharing programs, but you never know exactly what you’re getting on these platforms. It may cost a few dollars, but downloading directly from trusted sources keeps your information and your computer safe and secure.\n- Use an Antivirus Program\nEven for those who take every possible precaution, the danger of viruses is never completely eliminated. Hackers are constantly searching for new security loopholes and other ways to exploit the internet to their advantage, and they are more clever than you’d think. Take the extra measure of obtaining a high quality antivirus program. Update your protection software frequently so that it will be able to recognize the latest viruses and run regular scans to make sure your computer is clean.\n- Manual, Not Automatic\nAutomatic downloads should be universally avoided. You should personally approve of any files or programs that are downloaded to your computer, including software and security updates. Some websites will attempt to download and install programs on your hard drive, and these are almost always malicious files. Look over every potential download and reject any that appear to be fishy. If a suspicious file transfer starts without your permission, try to cancel it before completion, or delete it as soon as possible from your downloads folder. Keeping your computer safe will always require some degree of vigilance, so don’t let your guard down.", "label": 1}
{"text": "There are many advantages to HTTP Basic Authentication, but despite these advantages, web developers have turned almost exclusively to using cookie-based authentication because of some limitations in how HTTP Basic Authentication can be implemented. Until recently, there has been no way to for developers to control the login form nor provide a way for users to log out.\nThe advantages of using HTTP Basic Authentication are easier integration. In particular, mod_auth_mysql for Apache makes it possible to easily password-protect areas based on usernames, passwords and roles stored in a central authentication database. The main alternative for authentication, cookie-based authentication, provides a higher barrier for integration projects.\nDespite the integration advantages, most web developers use cookie-based authentication because they want to control the user experience of logging in.

{"text": "Last time, I introduced you to SELinux: what it is, what it can do, and really why you need it (or a system like it). It is especially important with reported (and fixed) security vulnerabilities on the rise, and each year brings more reports, and more updates for end-users to install. This data tells us that we are in greater need of proactive security measures now than we ever were before. And this is where software like SELinux fits in.\nThere is a lot to SELinux, and we’re only going to touch on SELinux contexts and labels. Suffice it to say, SELinux policies contain various rules that allow interaction between different contexts. Contexts are ports, processes, files, directories, and so on. Instead of getting overwhelmed with the technical concepts of SELinux, we’ll instead look at the practical side of using SELinux so that it doesn’t seem quite as daunting.\nThe first thing to do is determine what mode SELinux is running in:\nThe getenforce command tells us what mode SELinux is in. The possible modes are Enforcing, Permissive, or Disabled. Enforcing means that SELinux will report access violations and deny the attempt, Permissive tells SELinux to report the violation but allow it, and Disabled completely turns SELinux off.\nIdeally, if you are unprepared to run SELinux in Enforcing mode, it should be in Permissive mode.\nThis can be set at boot by editing (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora) the /etc/sysconfig/selinux file and setting the SELINUX option:\nThis will ensure it persists across reboot. SELinux can transition from Enforcing to Permissive easily using the setenforce command. Providing setenforce with a “0″ argument will put the system in Permissive mode, a “1″ will set it to Enforcing. To transition to or from Disabled mode, you need to reboot after making the appropriate changes to the sysconfig file. Using setenforce can be a great way of troubleshooting problems; if the problem goes away after setting the system to Permissive mode then you know it is SELinux.\nIf not, then it is something else.\n# setenforce 0\nTo view the contexts that a process is running with, add the Z option to ps:\n# ps auxZ | grep httpd\nsystem_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 apache 30544 0.0 0.0 305612 6688 ? S Mar30 0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd\nThis tells us that the httpd process is using the httpd_t type, the system_r role, and the system_u user. More often than not, it is the httpd_t type you would be interested in.\nThe Z option is also used with other commands, such as ls, cp, id, and others. For instance, to view your security context:\n# id -Z\nOr to view the security context associated with a file:\n# ls -lZ /var/www/html/index.html\n-rw-r--r--. root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 /var/www/html/index.html\nAgain, probably the most useful bit of information here is the type, in this case it is httpd_sys_content_t.\nAs an example of how to quickly change the policy, assume that you do not put your websites in /var/www/, but rather use /srv/www/foo.com/html/ for your site’s document root. You can configure Apache to use these directories as the DocumentRoot for various websites, but if you were to visit them, Apache would return an error because SELinux would disallow access. SELinux knows nothing about allowing Apache to these directories as of yet.\nTo determine what type a file needs to have in order for Apache to access it, the above ls command tells us that the type we want is probably httpd_sys_content_t; after all, Apache by default serves files from /var/www/html/. Another, probably better, way is to use the semanage tool.\nThis tool is used to show, and change, defined SELinux policy. We could also do:\n# semanage fcontext -l | grep '/var/www'\n/var/www(/.*)? all files system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0\nThis command tells semanage to list all fcontext entries (file contexts), and we hand that output to grep to search for and display ‘/var/www’. For brevity, the whole output is not shown, but the above confirms that /var/www/* has the httpd_sys_content_t type. So what we need to do is tell SELinux to give this same type to /srv/www/foo.com/html/*, so that Apache can serve up those files.\nThis can be done by using semanage to add a new context:\n# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/srv/www(/.*)?'\n# semanage fcontext -l | grep '/srv/www'\n/srv/www(/.*)? all files system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0\n# restorecon -Rv /srv/www\nThe SELinux policies here use regular expressions, so the above tells semanage to add (-a) a new fcontext with the type (-t) httpd_sys_content_t, and targets /srv/www itself and any sub-directories and files. We use semanage to list the fcontexts and search for any ‘/srv/www’ entries, to verify it is in place, and then use restorecon to re-label and set the appropriate security context on the /srv/www directory and any sub-directories and files.\nAt this point, Apache will serve content from that directory if configured to do so, because Apache has the right to read httpd_sys_content_t files and /srv/www/ will now be labeled correctly.\nThe restorecon tool is used to set default contexts on files and directories, according to policy. You will become very familiar with this tool because it is used very often. For instance, if you move a file from a home directory to this web root, it will not immediately gain the appropriate security context because the mv command retains the existing context (cp will make a new context because it is making a new file). For instance:\n% echo \"my file\" >file.html\n% ls -Z file.html\n-rw-rw-r--. vdanen vdanen unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file.html\n% mv file.html /srv/www/foo.com/html/\n% ls -Z /srv/www/foo.com/html/\n-rw-rw-r--. vdanen vdanen unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file.html\nApache is not, by default, allowed to serve up user_home_t files, so any attempt to display this file via Apache will fail with denied access. restorecon is required to re-label the file so Apache can access it:\n# restorecon -v /srv/www/foo.com/html/file.html\nrestorecon reset /srv/www/foo.com/html/file.html context unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0->system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0\nNow the security context of the file is correct.\nSimilarly, when going from Disabled mode to Permissive or Enforcing mode, SELinux will have to re-label the entire filesystem (effectively running “estorecon /) because contexts are not set at all when SELinux is disabled.\nOnce you wrap your head around these basics of SELinux, all of a sudden it is no more difficult to use than manipulating iptables firewall rules. Just as you would adjust your firewall to allow access to a new service, you adjust SELinux file contexts to allow applications and services to access them. Yes, it does require a little more work to set up, initially, but the security benefits are really quite useful, especially considering that the bulk of this kind of manipulation will only happen when initially setting up a system or adding new services. And getting into the habit of running restorecon on new files and directories as they are created isn’t any more difficult than using ls on them to double-check their permissions.\nThe next and final tip on SELinux will introduce us to SELinux logging, to detect access violations, and to some other basic SELinux commands.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Exchange Server 2013 provides a high level of security for client-server and server-server communications by using certificates to secure protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP and IMAP.\nBecause of the “secure by default” requirements, when an Exchange 2013 server is installed it is configured with self-signed certificates that are enabled for those protocols.\nHere is an example of the self-signed certificates installed on a new Exchange 2013 server.\n[PS] C:\\>Get-ExchangeCertificate | Select Subject,IsSelfSigned,Services | ft -auto Subject IsSelfSigned Services ------- ------------ -------- CN=Microsoft Exchange Server Auth Certificate True SMTP CN=E15MB1 True IMAP, POP, IIS, SMTP CN=WMSvc-E15MB1 True None\nAlthough this means that services such as Outlook Web App, Outlook Anywhere, and Activesync are secure right from the moment the Exchange server is installed, the use of self-signed certificates is only intended to be temporary while the administrator acquired the correct SSL certificates for the server.\nSAN/UC Certificates for Exchange Server 2013\nExchange 2013 uses a type of SSL certificate that is known as a “Subject Alternate Name” (SAN) certificate. In some cases this will be called a “Unified Communications” (UC) certificate by providers such as Digicert.\nA SAN certificate is an SSL certificate that has multiple server or domain names on the one certificate. This means that you can use a single certificate to secure one or more Exchange 2013 servers, and it can include all of the server names and other external URLs you plan to use for your Exchange environment, instead of having to provision a single-named SSL certificate for each of the different names.\nPlanning for Exchange 2013 SSL Certificates\nThere are three requirements for an SSL certificate to work correctly in your Exchange 2013 environment.\nCertificate Validity Period\nThe certificate validity period is the period of time between when the certificate was issued and when it expires. Every SSL certificate will have an expiry date, and this will vary depending on how the certificate has been provisioned.\nThe default, self-signed certificate that Exchange 2013 creates during setup is valid for 5 years. A certificate issued from a private certificate authority may be valid for several years as well.\nA certificate that has been acquired from a commercial certificate authority such as Digicert will usually be valid for one year.\nTrusted Certificate Authority\nFor a client to trust the SSL certificate that a server is using the certificate must be issued by a certificate authority that the client already trusts.\nIf you’re using a private certificate authority to issue SSL certificates to your Exchange 2013 servers, and that CA is an enterprise CA in your AD forest, then that CA will already be trusted by clients that are members of domains in that AD forest. Non-domain members will not trust the CA unless the root certificate is imported into their trusted CA list.\nThe major commercial certificate authorities are already trusted by the operating systems running on most computers or mobile devices, so when you acquire your certificate from one of those CAs it will be trusted by connecting clients as well.\nThese trust issues mean that although you can use a private CA to issue your SSL certificates, it tends to be easier and less administrative effort to use a commercial CA.\nNote: this trust issue only applies to the certificates installed on a dedicated Client Access server. The Mailbox server can use self-signed certificates because it does not accept direct client connections. In a multi-role server the trust issue still applies.\nCorrect Server/Domain Names\nThe final requirement is that the server or domain name that the client is connecting to must match one of the names on the SSL certificate.\nFor example, if the clients use the URL https://webmail.exchangeserverpro.net/owa to connect to Outlook Web App, then the SSL certificate on the Exchange server must include the name “webmail.exchangeserverpro.net”.\nAt minimum the SSL certificate should include the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Exchange server itself. Then, depending on the role and configuration of the server, it may also need several other names for external access methods.\nFor example, an internet-facing Client Access server named “excas1″ in the “exchangeserverpro.net” domain would need:\n- the server FQDN of “excas1.exchangeserverpro.net”\n- the OWA, OA, Activesync external URL names, eg “mail.exchangeserverpro.net”\n- the Autodiscover name for the primary SMTP namespace, eg “autodiscover.exchangeserverpro.net”\nIn an Exchange 2007 to 2013 upgrade/co-existence scenario the certificate may also need to include a legacy name, such as “legacy.exchangeserverpro.net”.\nIf you’re using an internal DNS namespace that you don’t own or is not valid (eg, .local) you may also need to read How to Deal with SSL Requirements for Exchange when Certificate Authorities Won’t Issue You a Certificate\nHow Many SSL Certificates to Configure?\nFor ease of administration, as well as for lower costs, it is recommended to provision as few certificates as possible. Consider that the Exchange servers in a given site will likely have the same configurations such as external URLs, so the only variation in their certificate requirements is the server FQDN itself.\nBecause the SSL certificate can include as many names as you need (up to about 50 before it may begin to cause performance issues), and with the way SAN/UC certificates are priced, it is often less costly to use a single SAN certificate for multiple servers than to acquire a unique certificate for each server.\nAlso consider that the trust issues when using a private CA to issue the SSL certificates generally only apply to the internet-facing servers that will be accepting connections from non-domain members such as mobile devices. It may be possible in your environment to use a private CA to issue the SSL certificates for the non-internet-facing servers, as they may only be seeing direct connections from domain members.\nThe best number of certificates to configure is something for you to determine in the planning for your unique environment, but generally speaking fewer certificates is less costly and more manageable.\nAfter planning your certificate requirements the next steps are:\n- Generate a Certificate Request for Exchange 2013\n- Submit the certificate request to your chosen CA to acquire the SSL certificate. I recommend Digicert for their competitive pricing, good support, flexible licensing, and free re-issues if you happen to make an error. Or if you’re using a private CA refer to these steps.\n- Complete the pending certificate request\n- Export/import an SSL certificate to multiple Exchange 2013 servers (optional)\n- Assign the SSL certificate to services in Exchange 2013", "label": 1}

When we copy the file names to notepad, save them as a Unicode text file and open them with a hex editor we see the following (the upper is for the first “hosts” file, the lower is for the second “hosts” file):\nFor Unicode (UTF-16), the 0x006F is the same as 0x6F in ASCII, which is the character “o”. But what’s the 0x043E in Unicode? We can find it in Unicode chart table (Range: 0400-04FF). The following is part of this table.\nWe can see that Unicode 0x043E is a Cyrillic character, and it looks very much like the English character “o”. So the hidden “hosts” file is the real hosts file in fact. When we open this file, we can see that two entries have been added to the end of the file:\nThis is not the first time we’ve seen a hacker using Unicode characters to mislead people. In Aug 2010, a Chinese hacker disclosed a trick with a Unicode control character used to mislead people into running an executable file. Hackers use Unicode control characters 0x202E (RLO) to reverse parts of a special file name, which changes the look of the file name in Windows Explorer.\nFor example, there is a file named as “picgpj.exe”, as the following:\nThe “gpj.exe” part of this name is specially crafted. When inserting an RLO character before “gpj.exe” in this name, the whole name appears as the following:\nHackers also usually use a picture as the file icon. Unwary people treat this file as a picture, and blindly double-click to open it, thus running the executable. Obviously, this type of trick is useless for Unicode aware programs, but it is not easy for the eyes of people to identify the problem.\nCan we believe our eyes? The answer is... not always.", "label": 1}
{"text": "It’s the Beginning of the End of Cash. Sweden is pointing the way to a cash-free economy. There are many things to dislike about analog money. Cash and coins are unwieldy, heavy and dirty. Despite Square and PayPal and other services that would seem to herald the end of cash, bills and coins still represent 7 percent of America’s total economy. In Sweden, which ranked first in this year’s Global Information Technology Report from the World Economic Forum — cash is even scarcer than in the USA. While Sweden was the first European country to introduce bank notes in 1661, it’s now come farther than any other country in the attempt to eradicate them. In most Swedish cities, public buses don’t accept cash; tickets are prepaid or purchased with a cell phone text message. A small but growing number of businesses only take cards, and some bank offices — which make money on electronic transactions — have stopped handling cash altogether. ‘There are towns where it isn’t at all possible anymore to enter a bank and use cash,’ complains Curt Persson, chairman of Sweden’s National Pensioners’ Organization. He says that’s a problem for elderly people in rural areas who don’t have credit cards or don’t know how to use them to withdraw cash.\nEven churches and houses of worship are becoming increasingly friendly to cash-free transactions: At the Carl Gustaf Church in Karlshamn, southern Sweden, Vicar Johan Tyrberg recently installed a card reader to allow worshipers to tithe in digital form.\nIt may be the beginning of the end of cash. Sweden’s innovations suggest a future in which cash is increasingly rare. It’s no surprise that Sweden and other Nordic countries are at the forefront of this development, given their emphasis on technology and innovation.\nCASH, CYBERCASH AND CRIME\nA cash-reduced culture gives rise to new concerns – “cybersecurity” and “privacy”. Oscar Swartz, the founder of Banhof, Sweden’s first Internet provider, puts it like so: “One should be able to send money and donate money to different organizations without being traced every time.” Swedish crime statistics suggest a correlation between cash and crime. The number of bank robberies in Sweden has dropped from 110 in 2008 to 16 in 2011 — “the lowest level,” reporter Malin Rising notes, “since it started keeping records 30 years ago.” The Swedish Bankers’ Association also says that robberies of security transports are down.\nSweden has less of a problem with graft, the AP says, than countries with a stronger cash culture. “If people use more cards, they are less involved in shadow economy activities,” economics professor Friedrich Schneider argued. And others note that a cash-reduced culture will disincentivize pickpocketers and muggers: When a card can simply be cancelled, what’s the point?But what about cybercrime? According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, the number of computerized fraud cases, including skimming, surged to nearly 20,000 in 2011 from 3,304 in 2000. Sweden was the first European country to introduce bank notes in 1661..but now it’s come farther than most on the path to getting rid of them. ‘I can’t see why we should be printing bank notes at all anymore,’ says Bjoern Ulvaeus, former member of 1970s pop group ABBA and a vocal proponent for a world without cash. The prevalence of electronic transactions — and the digital trail they generate — also helps explain why Sweden has less of a problem with graft than countries with a stronger cash culture, such as Italy or Greece, says economics professor Friedrich Schneider of the Johannes Kepler University in Austria.\nCash and coins leave no automatic record of the financial transactions that are made with them. ‘If people use more cards, they are less involved in shadow economy activities,’ says Schneider, a so called expert on underground economies. Who benefits most in a cashless society? The BANKSTERS, of course. They can rob but they can’t be robbed. In a cashless society, they control all the wealth and YOU ARE PENNILESS.

{"text": "Welcome to my second guide in Seven Forums.\nBefore we begin...\nIn computer networking, we all know the term \"Firewall\". Before we get into \"what is firewall\" question, I'd like to explain about frames and packets. If you read my previous guide about \"Internetwork Troubleshooting Guide\"\n, I talk a lot about packets and frames. For those who read my first guide, this one will shed more light into computer internetworks.\nA fast refresh on internetworking terms.\n- Frames - Works in Layer 2, in this case I'll be using Ethernet (there are several others). It contains information that needs to be sent/returned to a certain MAC address.\n- IP Packets - Works in Layer 3, in this case I'll be using TCP as this is what we primarily use.\n- TCP Packets - Works in Layer 4.\nHere's the visual presentation of what an Ethernet frame looks like:\nNow, before I made this guide, I wrote quite a bit about firewall in this thread\n, this guide will complete that post.\nOk, now let's begin...\nTo secure a computer network, you need to \"limit\" what can flow from one side to the other. Computer network are comprised of 2 general types:\n- \"Switched\" network, most of the time we call \"LAN\".\n- \"Routed\" network, most of the time we call \"the great wide Internet\".\nWhen do you need to use which?\nWhen you want to connect one computer to another computer, you will need a \"Switched\" network. Back in the day, this is done by several devices, Hubs, Switches, Repeaters, Access Points, and several others. A computer network is a network of computers that physically are connected together by means of wired or wireless methods. To make sure this network \"works\", you need to logically set so that these computers are on the same \"Network\" (read my first guide\nabout this topic).\nNow, in a small lab - this setup works. You can have tens or hundreds of computers networked together, BUT once you hit several hundred computers, it start to get overwhelming. From a security standpoint, having hundreds of computers networked together IS NOT SAFE. If a computer got infected by a malware that can scan local network for other hosts, you are screwed since the malware will have access to hundreds of computers DIRECTLY, thus another type of network came along - the \"Routed\" network.\nTo simplify hundreds of computer network, we need to segment the network. Let's say we group those computers by it's physical locations - 15 computers as \"Ground office\", 20 computers as \"2nd floor office\", 3 servers \"Servers\" and so on. Tthat hundreds of computers now look much simpler, instead of hundreds of hosts, we see only several networks. Each network can only communicate with each other, it can't cross over to other networks even if it's on the same switch. This time we need a \"Router\". This is one AWESOME device. It can route/bridge between networks. It can make inter network communication possible. Let's say if the computers on \"Ground floor\" got infected by a nasty worm, most of the time you only need to maintain computers in that network, the worm rarely able to move from network to network.\nNow, since we understand that computer networks need to be segmented - this is what happened globally. In offices, in schools, at homes, everyone is segmenting their networks. Now why did I say that routers are AWESOME devices? Different than switch, routers understand what's passing over it's interfaces. You see the diagram I showed you above, a Switch only understand the first row. A switch only checks what the receiver/sender MAC address and acts accordingly. A router on the other hand understands EVERY ROW on that diagram, several expensive routers can even see and understand the \"Data\" part inside a TCP packet.\nSince a router can see very deep into the frames/packets that's going in and out of it, it can now do some checking of things that's coming and going through it. This is what's called \"Firewall\", it checks things and if those things matched a rule (or some rules) stated in the router's memory, the router will act on those frames/packets accordingly as stated in the rule(s). [Great, I spend too much text just to get to the routing part of computer network... *sigh*]\nNow, there are several types of \"Firewall\" techniques that are common. I say techniques because that's what it is, it's a technique or method to check packets that's coming/going through the router. These are the commonly used techniques:\n- Address Translation\n- Stateful Checking\n- Packet Filtering\n- Application layer probe\nAs we understand now, in a common home network there are 2 distinct networks exist. The first is the \"LAN\" part, your computers, XBOX360, laptops, netbooks, PS3s, and so on. The second is the \"WAN\" part, your ISP's part. To bridge between these distinct networks, we usually use a \"broadband gateway\", or \"broadband router\", or \"internet gateway\"... All of these products are routers in essence, they connect your local network to ISP's public network and securing you in the process.\nHere's an example of a simple home network:\nPC[10.1.1.10]---[10.1.1.1]Router[126.96.36.199]---[188.8.131.52]Yahoo.com 1. Address translation\nAddress translation is the most commonly used technique in consumer grade \"firewall\", it's the easiest to implement, no logging, very safe by default, and moderately fast. What and how does it do to secure our network? There are 2 things it does, first is Network address Translation (NAT) and the second is Port Address Translation (PAT). See my picture above. In an IP packet, there always be a \"Sender IP address\" and \"Receiver IP address\" segment in the packets. IP packets contain TCP packet as it's data. In TCP packet, there are informations about destination's port address, ACK, Checksum, etc.\nIn the home network simple illustration, we have a PC that wants to connect to Yahoo.com through port 80 (common web server listen port is 80), when the PC's browser requests to Yahoo.com, it will send packets to Router[10.1.1.1]. Here's when the magic works. In the router, PC's IP packets will have \"Sender IP address\" segment filled with \"10.1.1.10\" and TCP packet's \"Sender Port number\" with some random port number generated by web browser when it initiates the communication. Now, when that packet arrived, the router will save this \"Sender IP address\" and \"Sender Port number\" to a table in the router's memory, CHANGE THE SENDER IP ADDRESS to \"184.108.40.206\"\nthen send it to Yahoo.com. Once Yahoo received the packet, asking for a webpage, Yahoo will then send it's webpage packets back to your router because the \"Sender IP address\" now is your router. Once the packet arrived at your router, it will then check against it's \"sent packets\" table, OH!! it found an entry, so the arrived packets are then again translated the packet's \"Receiver IP address\" back to \"10.1.1.10\", send the packet to the PC, then flush the table entry. PC receives the packet reads the data and draw the Yahoo page... This is how NAT do it's thing. PAT does the same thing, but it changed the \"Port number\" instead \"IP address\". [quoted from my own post]\nNow how can this simple mechanism protects you? It's easy... Since your router keeps a list of what your computer(s) requests to what/where/when, it also knows what is NOT requested, see the logic? If say some kid from china has your IP and try to send something to your public IP - which then arrived at your router, the packets will be checked against a list of hosts that you previously asked for, and this Chinese IP address is not one of them... So, by default the packets from the Chinese IP gets dropped off just like that, as if nothing happens. See, this is the basic principal of how NAT works. The rogue packets won't even be able to reach your computer, regardless if your computer has firewall or not.\nNow, after everything done, you are safe to browse the net, watch youtube, update your status in facebook, read the news, listen to last.fm, and so on... But then you bumped to an issue. As you understand, NAT will drop everything that's not in it's list as if it's a rogue packet. If you play an online game, and you're hosting a session, your computer will \"listen\" to requests off of the Internet. Now... this is getting frustrating - IF your router doesn't have the list requests and your computer doesn't request anything (it's on \"listening\" mode), you won't be able to create any game session, your friends won't be able to join your game, because every attempt they make will be dropped by your router. HOLY CRAP !!! But wait, there's a way to \"poke a hole\" in NAT, it's called \"Port Forwarding\". In a sense, \"Port Forwarding\" will forward EVERY packets that arrived at the router that has specific port number in them. When you host a game, usually the game will tell you that it will be using one or more ports (say you're playing CoD:MW2, it uses 1500, 3005, 3101, 27000-27050, 28960 ports). So, to make a hole in your NAT or effectively saying to your router that every packets that are arrived at those ports are to be sent (and translated of course) directly to your PC, you need to make a \"Port forwarding rule\". Usually in modern routers it has UPnP, it's the magical protocol that will make a hole in your firewall without you making any changes to it (automatically generates a \"Port forwarding rule\" by it self), sometimes without your consent. In a more conventional router (Cisco business/cloud class routers), usually you need to create your own port forwarding rule, it doesn't have UPnP or UPnP is disabled by default because of security reasons. In some routers it's called \"Virtual server\". Now, if you're a security concise person, you don't want UPnP running... but on the other hand, it will save your time in configuring port forwarding. I personally disable UPnP because of the security reasons. Imagine you got infected by some new undetected malware botnet client, and it uses UPnP to poke a hole in your firewall and contacted it's master server, the whole NAT firewall technique cannot save you, because the request are made from inside, and what's inside poke a hole to your defense so that what's from outside can go in... That is terrible... But, you know... consumers - they want it easy and\nsecure, which is almost impossible... [/quoted from my own post] 2. Stateful Checking\nIn stateful checking, the router will check if it has opened a communication session with the remote host. Using the sample from previous case, the router checks if it already opens a communication session with Yahoo.com, if so, then the packets from Yahoo is then permitted to pass. If let's say someone from china tests your firewall, the packets from china will arrive at your firewall, checked if the router has an open session with the china person, if it doesn't have any sessions, the packets are the dropped. 3. Packet Filtering\nNow, this is the FUN one. This technique requires a quite powerful hardware to achieve high throughput. It basically checks EVERY PACKETS to a set of rules it has. Let's say, I don't want the router to be PING-able from the internet. I put a Packet Filter rule that says, \"if it receive an ICMP 'Echo' packet in the 'Input' stage, drop the packet\". If I don't want any of computers in my LAN to contact Yahoo, I put a packet filter rule that says \"Destination IP address = Yahoo.com, drop the packet\". You can filter almost anything by using Packet Filtering. You can even cripple the network using Packet Filtering... This technique is VERY POWERFUL. 4. Application layer probe\nSeveral expensive routers (and Linux/BSD Firewall distribution) can inspect a packet very deeply. It can understand the data within the packets and then analyze it. This method requires A VERY POWERFUL HARDWARE to be able to reach a high throughput. Here's an example of the rule: I want if any Yahoo Messanger chat text contains the \"F\" word, I need that word to be changed with \"*peep*\" text before it reaches Yahoo's servers, and the router will do just that. This technique is very powerful, but IMHO is very limited in application, since it target certain application. I rarely use this technique in my own router (my Mikrotik router can do ALL techniques I talked about).\nWell, that's all for now, I'll write the *not simplified version* some other time... I hope you enjoyed the read", "label": 1}

Let me take a few examples:\nAlmost all transactions in shares are in demat form. Almost all companies extensively depend upon their computer networks and keep their valuable data in electronic Form.\nGovernment forms including income tax returns, company law forms etc are now filled in electronic form. Consumers are increasingly using credit cards for shopping. Most people are using email, cell phones and SMS messages for communication. Even in “non-cyber crime” cases, important evidence is found in computers / cell phones e.g. in cases of divorce, murder, kidnapping, tax evasion, organized crime, terrorist operations, counterfeit currency etc.\nCyber crime cases such as online banking frauds, online share trading fraud, source code theft, credit card fraud, tax evasion, virus attacks, cyber sabotage, phishing attacks, email hijacking, denial of service, hacking, pornography etc are becoming common. Digital signatures and e-contracts are fast replacing conventional methods of transacting business.(1)\nCyberspace refers to the nonphysical environment created by joined computers interoperating on a network. In cyberspace, computer operators interact in ways similar to the real world, except cyberspace interaction does not require physical movement beyond typing. Information can be exchanged in real time or delayed time, and people can shop, share, explore, research, work or play.\nThe Internet forms the largest cyberspace environment, housing many sub-environments within it.

Maybe this is a very pure idea , but I am sure one day it can be an executive acting. I’ve thought how we can make an internet & virtual courts in 21st century. This means a victim can placed in a part of world, jury group or judges in another part of the world and as a result, all elements of a court be in somewhere but with combining the Law, communication and IT technology we make a virtual courtroom.\nWhen I sat in the Dr.Bahma CYBERLAW class , in one second , I see my dream there. CYBER LAW and CYBER SPACE and the issues that around them are very near and close to my idea. now I try to know a new thing and it is a CYBERSPACE and its relation with CYBERLAW. I hope in future I can take my final project in this area.\nIn this post I want to show in general “what is CYBER LAW?” . Of course, it is not very simple to explain CYBER LAW in a very short post but the reason to say something about it can be a symptom to enter to a wide area called CYBER SPACE and CYBER LAW.\nAccording to my recent knowledge and finding information about CYBER SPACE & CYBER LAW ( in Dr.Bahma’s class and some activities in internet) I can say and conclude that nothing different from real situation and Cyber space . The things that push people to do and show bad behaviour in real Space and Cyber is lack of ETHICS. The main different element in cyber space , that allow guilty to do crimes is invisibility .\nThe new technology in this century is like a coin with two sides. One side of Growing Technology is Helping to the speed of moving and another side is remove calm and privacy from the life of everybody that use this technologies.\nThe things that can control users in this kind of technology , after observing ethics , can be the LAW . I want to talk about this part of story in LAW IN CYBER weblog and analysis why and how the users think can have a right to stalk & Harass& & Threat in this atmosphere. I will gather some cases about this area of CYBER SPACE CRIME and write some things more about them\nIn conclusion and from my view , CYBER SPACE AND CYBER LAW is a very important part of every users that want to access and use internet, intranet, VPN or any usable and common networks in the virtual world. The Law in Cyberspace can guide people to go on the right way of using this technologies. Everyone who connect to the internet should know here is a place that million of million people live in it and this new and cyber life has a role to live and must obey the roles.\nIn further posts, we will talk and discuss more about this issue , together and with peace and in a very free situation.", "label": 1}
{"text": "How? read on.\nA “hidden” encrypted volume provides you with “plausible deniability” should the need ever arise. For example, if your drives were seized, and you were forced under order of court to reveal the password – then your hidden drive would provide an extra layer of security. How? We will first create an outer volume that is encrypted, and hide some fake files on there. Then within that encrypted outer volume, we will create a further encrypted volume. You end up with two password-protected volumes – and you can safely reveal the outer volume password – without revealing a secondary hidden volume. The TrueCrypt page has a more technical explanation of a Hidden Volume that you might want to read.\nYou will need\nSince we’ve covered basic Truecrypt file and folder encryptions before, today I will be using an entire partition. This could be a USB hard drive or a second hard drive in your PC. This drive will be formatted entirely in the process, so make sure there is nothing important on it.\nYou will also need a copy of the latest TrueCrypt for your system, which you can download here. For this guide, I have used the Mac OSX version, but the interface is similar on Windows or Linux.\nCreate a Partition\nBegin by plugging in your drive and creating a partition that we will encrypt. I showed you how to create a partition on Windows last week, but on my OS X installation I simply opened Disk Utility, find the drive in the left side, and click on the Partition tab on the right. I chose 1 partition, gave it a name, and clicked Apply.\nCreate Encrypted Volume\nLaunch TrueCrypt and click on Create Volume. Choose the second option, which says “Create a volume within a partition / drive“.\nNext, choose to create a Hidden TrueCrypt Volume.\nBe careful when you select the device on the next screen. If you gave your partition a helpful name, you should have no problem. Go ahead and select the device.\nNext are the encryption options. The defaults are those deemed secure enough for top secret government documents, so it’s probably good enough for us.\nNext, you will need to choose a password for your outer volume. Remember, this will be a password you rarely ever use, but will be the one you give up if forced to. It is very important that this password be substantially different to the one you will encrypt your hidden drive with.\nThe next screen is a little difficult to explain, but suffice to say the more you move your mouse around, the more secure your drive will be. Just do it for about 30 seconds or so, then click Format.\nFor my 160 GB USB drive, it took about an hour and half just to encrypt the outer volume. This is a one-off thing though, when you actually use the drive you need only enter the password.\nNext, you need to copy some fake files to the encrypted disk. These can be anything, but ideally they should be private looking files, maybe some home movies – something you wouldn’t mind someone seeing if you were forced to reveal passwords. Warning: You shouldn’t write to this outer volume later, or your actual hidden volume may become corrupted. It is a fake storage container only to act as a diversion. Click on the button labelled Open Outer Volume, and start copying files in. Bear in mind that if you have a 1 TB drive and someone investigating finds only 100 MB of “secret” files, it may look a bit suspicious.\nWhen you’re done copying, go back and click next. TrueCrypt will automatically unmount the drive and figure out how much space you have left for your real hidden volume. You can make it as large as you like, but I like to leave a little room on the outer drive in case someone were to accidentally write to it.\nMake the outer volume in the same way, but this time make your password long, and really good. Include capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation. A good tactic if you don’t like random passwords is to create a sentence around it like: 20MILLIONsecretF1l3$. When asked if you’ll be storing large files, I suggest you choose ‘yes’ as the world of computing moves rapidly, and even today some movies are over 4 GB in size. Best to future-proof the drive now.\nWait again while the outer volume is encrypted. You can now mount your secure hidden volume via TrueCrypt, as it won’t be mounted by default once the hidden volume is created. Just click Mount All Devices, and type in the correct password. You don’t need to type both your outer volume password and your hidden one – just the hidden one is fine.\nIf you leave your computer on a lot of the time, don’t forget to unmount the drive. After a restart or shutdown the computer, the volume will be automatically dismounted.\nIf you read through this far, then obviously you have something worth hiding, and by utilising a hidden encrypted volume, you give yourself a way out should things go awry. Why bother encrypting a drive if the big-brother police state you are living in has the power to legally demand the decryption keys, or send you to jail? Don’t be a sucker, just give them the wrong keys!\nDownload TrueCrypt and try it out.\nImage credit: ShutterStock\nMore articles about:", "label": 1}
{"text": "POPUREB variants have a bootkit component that infect systems’ master boot record (MBR) by replacing this with its own malicious MBR. Bootkits infect systems’ MBR to execute their malicious routines even before the OS runs. These are known for storing their components outside standard file systems, making them difficult to detect by both the OS and most of the available consumer antivirus software.\nUsers may encounter these malware by visiting malicious sites that host them. These may also be downloaded by other malware onto users’ already-infected systems.\nPOPUREB variants are notable for having several components—an installer, a bootkit loader, a driver, and a payload component.\nWhat are POPUREB’s components and how does each of these function?\nThe main function of the installer component, detected as TROJ_POPUREB.SMA, is to write the malware’s components to the physical disk. It then reads and encrypts the system’s MBR and replaces this with its own malicious MBR. The installed malicious MBR then drops the driver component.\nThe driver component contains POPUREB’s drive access functionality, which means it reads the components written on the disk. It then drops and executes the payload component. The driver is also designed to prevent any write attempts to the components and to the malicious MBR that have been written on the physical disk.\nThe bootkit component, detected as RTKT_POPUREB.A, contains all of the malicious components that the attacker integrated into the malware. It is also responsible for keeping infected systems properly functioning despite the presence of malicious components. To do this, the bootkit loader also installs hooks and handlers.\nOnce executed, the payload component, detected as TROJ_POPUREB.SMB, initiates eight threads, including the creation of registry entries and connection to sites to download configuration files. It also executes POPUREB’s main malicious routines.\nHow does TROJ_POPUREB.SMB affect users?\nTROJ_POPUREB.SMB performs several malicious routines, including accessing malicious sites to send information and to download configuration files and other malware. Once installed, it also connects to a specific server to report that the infection was successful.\nWhat users should take better note of, however, is its capability to hijack browser sessions in order to create malicious HTTP traffic. This traffic may involve other payloads, including downloading other malware and displaying malicious online ads.\nHow do POPUREB variants affect users?\nAs malware with a bootkit component, POPUREB variants hide from users by infecting their systems’ MBR. As such, affected users may not readily notice the infection. Compared with other malware, these are also difficult to remove, as they are deeply rooted into infected systems, specifically in their MBR. The most severe POPUREB infection may even leave affected users no other choice but to reformat their systems. This may lead to the loss of important user data.\nAs previously stated, TROJ_POPUREB.SMB hijacks browser sessions to create HTTP traffic, which results in several problems for users. The said traffic may lead to the download of other malicious files onto already-infected systems, making them vulnerable to more infections. This traffic can also direct users to malicious ads that may serve as vectors of redirection to malicious sites such as phishing sites that steal credit card or other personally identifiable information (PII).\nWhat makes POPUREB variants noteworthy?\nMicrosoft at first thought POPUREB variants were bootkits that were capable of not only overwriting infected systems’ MBR but also of employing a driver component. This driver prevents any possible change on the physical disk where the malicious MBR and the other malicious components are written.\nInitial reports on POPUREB indicated that in order to clean infected systems, users may need to reformat their systems, which can lead to the loss of important information. Microsoft, however, clarified later on that cleanup via the Windows Recovery Console was enough to remove the bootkit from infected systems, thus users need not worry about suffering from data loss.\nUpon further analysis, our engineers also noted that because of its technological ease, POPUREB variants may be easily reused and improved by other cybercriminals. As a result, we may see more POPUREB-related attacks in the future, albeit with certain improvements.\nWhat makes POPUREB’s bootkit component different from those of bootkits like TDL4?\nEven though POPUREB’s bootkit component and TDL4 malware both overwrite infected systems’ MBR with their own malicious versions, they do differ somehow. TDL4 malware overwrite infected systems’ MBR to hide from the OS and from antivirus software. POPUREB variants, meanwhile, mainly use their MBR code to launch their driver component and the other data they write on infected systems’ disk sector. In effect, this makes POPUREB variants easier to detect compared with TDL4 malware. POPUREB variants do not encrypt data and create their own file systems as well. As such, these can be cleaned using the Windows Recovery Console.\nAre Trend Micro customers protected from POPUREB variants?\nPowered by the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™, Trend Micro products protect users from various POPUREB malware. File Reputation Technology detects and blocks the download of related malicious files onto users’ systems. Web Reputation Technology, on the other hand, blocks access to related malicious sites that host various POPUREB variants.\nFor machines that are infected by POPUREB variants, customers are advised to use the Rootkit Buster to effectively detect and remove POPUREB malware on affected computers.\nWhat can users do to prevent POPUREB variants from infecting their systems?\nRefrain from visiting unknown sites such as those that come up as search engine results.\nNever click links embedded in unsolicited spam nor download files attached to email messages from unknown sources.\nStay abreast of the latest news on emerging threats and read up on these to stay protected.\nMake it a habit to always back up sensitive information. This can save you from losing data in case of a bootkit infection.\nMicrosoft also released an advisory on how to effectively remove POPUREB variants from infected systems using the Windows Recovery Console. For more information on how you can do this, read this Microsoft blog post.\nAnalysis done by Patrick Estavillo, Vincent Cabuag, and Kathleen Notario\n\"POPUREB is not a very sophisticated malware. However, its technological ease is something that we should watch, as cybercriminals can easily learn its technology and create improved versions in the future.

{"text": "If you are using a GSM phone (AT&T or T-Mobile in the U.S.), you likely have a few more months before it will be easy for practically anyone to spy on your communications.\nSecurity researcher Karsten Nohl is launching an open-source, distributed computing project designed to crack the encryption used on GSM phones and compile it into a code book that can be used to decode conversations and any data that gets sent to and from the phone.\nKarsten Nohl talks about his distributed computing, open-source AE/1 cracking project at the Hacking at Random conference.\n“We’re not creating a vulnerability but publicizing a flaw that’s already being exploited very widely,” he said in a phone interview Monday.\nThis weakness in the encryption used on the phones, A5/1, has been known about for years. There are at least four commercial tools that allow for decrypting GSM communications that range in price from $100,000 to $250,000 depending on how fast you want the software to work, said Nohl, who previously has publicized weaknesses with wireless smart card chips used in transit systems.\nIt will take 80 high-performance computers about three months to do a brute force attack on A5/1 and create a large look-up table that will serve as the code book, said Nohl, who announced the project at the Hacking at Random conference in the Netherlands 10 days ago.\nUsing the code book, anyone could get the encryption key for any GSM call, SMS message, or other communication encrypted with A5/1 and listen to the call or read the data in the clear. If 160 people donate their computing resources to the project, it should only take one and a half months to complete, he said.\nParticipants download the software and three months later they share the files created with others, via BitTorrent, for instance, Nohl said. “We have no connection to them,” he added.\nOnce the look-up table is created it would be available for anyone to use.\nSource: CNET News", "label": 1}
{"text": "The Federal Trade Commission today issued proposed revisions to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule, in an effort to ensure that privacy regulations keep pace with the changing online world.\nUnder the proposal, the rules would now specifically apply to mobile phones and the definition of “personal information” would expand to include data derived from tracking cookies and geolocation. That would force sites to secure parental consent before using very common online tools to gather information about children under 13.\n“We believe (the rules) will help address a number of concerns raised\nby consumer groups, privacy experts, and child advocates, while at the same time, balancing children’s ability to be active participants in digital culture with the need to protect them from unfair data collection and marketing practices,” said Kathryn Montgomery, professor of communication at American University, in a statement issued by the Center for Digital Democracy in Washington, D.C.\nBut critics say the rules would also create some sizable technical hurdles as well as legal uncertainties.\n“It is unclear how an expanded COPPA regulatory regime would work without requiring mandatory online age verification of all Internet users, which would raise serious constitutional issues,” wrote Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a free market think tank.\nIt would, for one thing, seem to require sites to know when a 12-year old sat down at a desktop computer regularly used by their mother, father or older sibling.\nWeb browser cookies are data files that store information to help sites identify a particular computer, which is used as a sort of best guess for identifying an actual person in the hopes of targeting advertising to online behavior.\nMeanwhile, geolocation data tracks the physical location of a person from information collected on mobile devices, through check-in apps like Foursquare, or map or navigation applications.\nThere are concerns that inserting an age verification process could make these sorts of tools more cumbersome, or undermine advances.\nJim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, said the industry is crying wolf, as it always does when staring at new privacy rules. These are all solvable technical issues for the deep-pocketed tech sector, he said.\n“The big players are coining money on this, it’s a boom time in the Valley, so to suggest that they don’t have the resources from a technical standpoint is a joke,” he said.\n“You’re talking about companies with $100 billion valuations,” he said. “They have a lot of money and brilliant engineers and we continually tout the innovation of Silicon Valley. So our point is: figure it out, kids matter.”\nThe FTC is seeking public comment on the proposed amendments.\n“In this era of rapid technological change, kids are often tech savvy but judgment poor,” FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in a prepared statement. “We want to ensure that the COPPA Rule is effective in helping parents protect their children online, without unnecessarily burdening online businesses.”\nRead on for the FTC’s summary of its proposals:\nThe COPPA Rule requires covered operators to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children. The FTC proposes updating the definition of “personal information” to include geolocation information and certain types of persistent identifiers used for functions other than the website’s internal operations, such as tracking cookies used for behavioral advertising. In addition, the Commission proposes modifying the definition of “collection” so operators may allow children to participate in interactive communities, without parental consent, so long as the operators take reasonable measures to delete all or virtually all children’s personal information before it is made public.\nParental Consent Mechanisms:\nThe FTC also proposes adding new methods to obtain verifiable parental consent, including electronic scans of signed parental consent forms, video-conferencing, and use of government-issued identification checked against a database, provided that the parent’s ID is deleted promptly after verification is done. These supplement the nonexclusive list of methods already set forth in the Rule.\nThe FTC proposes eliminating the less-reliable method of parental consent, known as “e-mail plus,” which is available to operators that collect personal information only for internal use. This method currently allows operators to obtain consent through an email to the parent, coupled with another step, such as sending a delayed email confirmation to the parent after receiving consent.\nTo encourage the development of new consent methods, the Commission proposes establishing a voluntary 180-day notice and comment process whereby parties may seek Commission approval of a particular consent mechanism. In addition, the Commission proposes permitting operators participating in a Commission approved safe-harbor program to use a method permitted by that program.\nConfidentiality and Security Requirements:\nTo better protect children’s personal information, the Commission proposes strengthening the Rule’s current confidentiality and security requirements. Specifically, the Commission proposes adding a requirement that operators ensure that any service providers or third-parties to whom they disclose a child’s personal information have in place reasonable procedures to protect it, that operators retain the information for only as long as is reasonably necessary, and that they properly delete that information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or use in connection with, its disposal.\nFinally, the FTC proposes to strengthen its oversight of self-regulatory “safe harbor programs” by requiring them to audit their members at least annually and report periodically to the Commission the results of those audits.", "label": 1}
{"text": "If you use free Wi-Fi in coffee shops or internet cafes to check your email, do some research or update your Facebook page, there are a couple of security issues you need to be aware of.\nFree Wi-Fi hotspots are vulnerable to so-called ‘channelling’ attackers - hackers who establish unauthorised access points alongside legitimate Wi-Fi services to steal user names and passwords. To protect yourself when using public Wi-Fi take the following steps:\n- Disable your wireless card if you’re not planning to connect to prevent intruders and preserve battery life.\n- Before connecting, check for a sign that the network name you’re planning to use has Secure Server Identification (SSID).\n- Be wary of sharing information in public locations. Hackers can use your webmail log-ins and passwords to access more sensitive information if you have the same password or a variation for all your online activities.\n- Disable shared folders to prevent the installation of spyware from a malicious network.\nWhen using internet cafes, choose one that looks professional. It can be hard to tell, but there are some good signs you can look for once you’re inside:\n- Users are forbidden from accessing the control panel settings or installing programs.\n- The computer requires a log-in to start the session.\n- The taskbar is uncluttered and free of strange applications. Unusual toolbars within browser windows are a tell-tale sign of a spyware riddled PC.\nUnfamiliar public computers may not be secured by antivirus, antispyware, or a firewall. You may ask the shop assistant a few questions about the security of their PCs, but always be suspicious and, as a rule of thumb, only access services you really must use. Assume the worst, as the machine you’re using is likely to be infected with malicious spyware and may be monitoring your browsing.\nIf you have to access confidential websites like internet banking services, double check that the website hasn’t been redirected by making sure you are using a secure ‘https’ connection. You can use these alternative ways of entering usernames and passwords to outwit keyloggers:\n- Windows has as ‘On Screen Keyboard’ built in to type passwords instead of using the keyboard. It is found though the menu at Start > Run > osk.exe\n- Use a word processor to type out the alphabet, then copy and paste the letters into the password field individually.\nMake sure you don’t tick the 'save password' or 'remember me' functions when using public computers. When you finish your session, clear your browsing history by selecting 'Delete Browsing History' from the browser menu. If you’ve divulged confidential information to a public computer, change your password at your next login to stay on the safe side.Bottom of Form", "label": 1}

This includes checking the authenticity of websites, not clicking on links from people you do not know, and watching out for phishing scams (by email, text or even voicemail) asking for personal information.\nSecure your phone\n- Turn on the security features of your phone. All phones have security settings, so familiarise yourself with them and turn them on.\n- Many mobile phones allow users to set a password or Personal Identification Number (PIN) that must be entered to use the phone. Passwords and PINs make it more difficult for thieves to steal your personal information if your phone is lost or stolen.\n- Put a PIN on your SIM card and password on your phone so that thieves cannot steal your phone credit or run up your phone bill.\n- Consider installing security software from a reputable provider. Anti-virus, anti-theft, anti-malware and firewall software is available for some mobile phone operating systems. Check with your phone manufacturer for recommendations.\n- Check for updates to your phones operating system regularly. Install them as soon as they are available – these updates often contain changes that will make your phone more secure.\n- Bluetooth lets you wirelessly connect to devices and transfer information over short distances. For Bluetooth to work, devices need to see each other and then connect. It is best to leave your phone in undiscoverable mode (hidden) so that it is only visible when you specifically need other people or devices to see it. This means that hackers cannot easily see your phone and they cannot easily connect to it unless they already have your Bluetooth address. When connecting using Bluetooth, do so in private, uncrowded areas only.\n- Be smart with Wi-Fi. When connecting to the internet using Wi-Fi, try to use an encrypted network that requires a password and which you are sure is operated by a reputable provider.

{"text": "Emerging platforms may improve collaborations between physicians, pharmacists, genetic researchers, and computer scientists working on clinical trials. [© Kirill_M - Fotolia.com]\nThe cost of DNA sequencing has plummeted in the last decade since the human genome was published. Expenses are dropping by about 50% every five months. Last August the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) reported that researchers had received more than $24 million in grants to develop sequencing technologies that are expected to rapidly sequence a person’s genome for $1,000 or less.\nBut none of that sequence data helps anyone if it is inaccessible, uninterpretable, or isn’t linked to a functionality. As genomics starts to inform proteomics and personalized medicine, it’s going to take massive amounts of computer power for storage capacity, data management, and analysis. The amount of data generated could reach the petabyte range; A petabyte is a unit of information equal to 1,000 terabytes, or 1 billion megabytes.\nThe petabyte crisis and the need to use all that data to discover novel therapeutics provide ready-made forcing functions to move companies into the cloud. Firms are leveraging cloud-based resources to bolster storage and analysis of the huge amounts of data generated from research and clinical development involving next-generation sequencing.\nKey questions being asked by professionals are whether there will be sufficient storage capacity for all that information in healthcare systems, will the information be routinely searchable as new and potentially relevant discoveries are made, and will it be possible to routinely share structured genomic data across healthcare systems. Another big question is will it be possible to make the best clinical decisions for a patient in the context of all that data.\nCloud computing companies have recognized the opportunity to answer these questions and are putting down big stakes. On October 12, Google Ventures co-led a $15 million round of financing for sequencing informatics specialist DNAnexus. Using Google Cloud Storage, the company expects to provide a long-term solution for researchers who require access to the vast repository of DNA sequencing data contained in the public Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database.\nThe SRA database was scheduled for shutdown by the NIH along with several other bioinformatics databases. As a part of its initiative with Google, DNAnexus will provide a freely accessible web-based search interface to simplify searching and accessing these datasets as well as improve their usability for life science research. Through this interface, researchers can also download sequence read files including all sequences from the 1,000 Genomes Project.\nUsers of the DNAnexus SRA website can also import SRA datasets into the commercial DNAnexus platform to access additional functionality such as mapping, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, variant analysis, and data visualization, as well as tools for integrating SRA data with their own sequence data.\n“The DNAnexus SRA website is an example of a ‘big data’ initiative that benefits from rethinking the interface in a 100% web-enabled world,” said Eric Morse, head of business development, Google Cloud Storage. “By combining Google’s massively scalable data storage infrastructure with DNAnexus’ expertise in web-based interfaces, genomics data analysis, and visualization, researchers can quickly access the world’s genomic information from any web browser.”\nOn November 10, Dell moved clinical practice in oncology closer to the cloud. It committed cloud computing technology, funding, and employee engagement to support pediatric cancer research programs. It is expected to speed computational processes, manage and store the resulting data, and provide a forum for analytics and collaboration.\nThe company’s foray into biomedical research will focus on a personalized medicine clinical trial being conducted by the Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC) and supported by The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen).\nTGen will use its genomic technology within Dell’s donated cloud to help NMTRC identify a greater depth of personalized treatment strategies for children with stage IV neuroblastoma who are enrolled in the NMRTC trial. The study is being conducted in at least 10 children’s cancer centers in the U.S.\nCenters will send tumor samples to TGen, and “T-Gen will run the gene sequencing on the individual patient tumor samples sent by the participating institutions,” James Coffin, Ph.D., vp and GM of Dell Healthcare and Life Sciences, explained to GEN.\nThe information will then be sent to the cloud for matching with drug(s) that have the highest success in treating the cancer and are impacting the most appropriate pathways. “In pediatric care in particular, you want to make sure you are using the most efficacious, least toxic drug,” said Dr. Coffin. “The way to do that is to match the tumor through a complete genomic tumor analysis from an individual patient, and then we know what pathways can be blocked by which drugs.”\nUp until now, the trial was primarily supported by parents and foundations. Dr. Coffin said that the first trial will enroll 13 pediatric patients with stage IV neuroblastoma, but with DELL’s support, the program’s participation is expected to grow to hundreds of patients over the next three years.\nThis will generate more than 200 billion measurements per patient that must be analyzed, shared, and stored, DELL predicted. Data computation and analysis of this information would have required weeks to months to process and thus would have limited the depth and number of pediatric cancer patients who could be included in the clinical trial. But DELL expects that the time needed for such large-scale studies will be reduced to just days through the use of DELL’s cloud.\nChanging Healthcare Paradigm\nFeasibility for this approach has been established by the trial’s lead investigator Giselle Scholler, M.D., pediatric oncologist at the Van Andel Research Institute (VARI). Dr. Scholler’s team evaluated the use of predictive modeling based on genome-wide mRNA expression profiles from neuroblastoma tumor biopsies to make real-time treatment decisions.\nUpon execution of five analytical methodologies, an OncInsights™ report was generated. These analytics included biomarker expression, drug target expression, network target activity, drug response signature, and drug sensitivity signature. The interactive report allows the physician and reviewing tumor board to quickly navigate the underlying knowledge and evidence at multiple levels.\nWhile the total drug pool available to this study currently comprises 182 FDA approved compounds, only those with established pediatric dosing were used. The pilot study results showed that all reports could be generated, a tumor board held, and an individualized treatment plan agreed to and approved by a medical monitor in ≤12 days.\nDELL has high hopes that its involvement in the large-scale trial and its cloud offering will provide the needed computing power to help increase TGen’s gene sequencing and analysis capacity by 1,200 percent.\nSuch platforms have the ability to improve collaborations between the team of physicians for a patient, pharmacists, genetic researchers, and computer scientists working on the trial. Academic scientists, clinicians, and computer companies are responding to the potential of the cloud by ramping up their partnerships to store, analyze, integrate, and share data. For healthcare the cloud is a key enabler of the information exchange that will allow the leap from episodic care to complete wellness management.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Trojan.Ramgad.A is a computer threat that has been on the loose since the beginning of 2012. There is nothing exception abotu Trojan.Ramgad.A since it is very similar to other Trojans when it comes to its tactics, but by no means does it mean it can be ignored. Trojan.Ramgad.A is quick to destroy the computer system by modifying memory, adding values to the registry and silently working in the background.\nAfter the installation which obviously occurs without the user's permission, Trojan.Ramgad.A injects a key into the registry and then loads automatically together with the OS. Afterwards it connects to a remote server using an HTTP protocol and communicates with the hacker that is responsible for infecting your system. Needless to say, that this communication that takes places without your knowledge or consent breaches your privacy. What is more, based on Trojan.Ramgad.A's components, this Trojan is a 100% backdoor, so being infected with it means that sooner or later you will your system crawling with all types and sorts of malware.\nIf you want to avoid that you need to remove Trojan.Ramgad.A immediately. Even though this Trojan does not manifest itself in any flamboyant way, you can still notice quite a few changes about the system that might pinpoint the infection. For example, slow operating speed and slow Internet connection are the first signs that something is wrong. Also, you might want to check for calc.exe, readerSTD.exe and svclock.exe in Windows Task Manager's process list. These process files are directly associated with Trojan.Ramgad.A and if you see them running, then the infection is definitely in.\nThese are also the files that you need to delete if you are going to terminate Trojan.Ramgad.A on your own.

{"text": "Answer Line: Why do I get so much spam?\nSpam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Carol asked why there's so much of it.\nWhy are there so many unwanted, tricky, manipulative, annoying, dangerous, and often illegal email messages going around? Because unscrupulous people can make a tidy profit mailing Spam. In 2010, Gmail spam expert Brad Taylor told Wired that “It costs $3,000 to rent a botnet and send out 100 million messages. It takes only 30 Viagra orders to pay for that.”\nBotnets--illegal networks of infected computers controlled by people other than their legitimate owners--make an important part of the spam equation. Not only do they send out a great deal of spam, but their owners use spam to infect more computers, and thus grow their botnets.\nThese spammers can get your email address from all sorts of sources. They can search infected PCs for anything that looks like an address. They can read them off of incoming and outgoing email. Hackers can break into e-tailers' databases and steal addresses (and worse).\nPosting your email address on a Web site, as I do for this blog, is asking for trouble. I get far more spam addressed to firstname.lastname@example.org than my other five email addresses put together. Luckily, mail to that address goes through two different spam filters before I get it.\nSo what can you do about it?\nBe careful about sharing your email address. If you're uncomfortable with giving a site your address, either don't give it, and create a temporary, disposable one for that purpose.\nFilter your email. Virtually all email clients--whether local or in the cloud--have spam filters these days. Use yours, and check it daily for false positives.\nBe skeptical. Just because a message appears to come from a friend doesn't mean it has. If there's something odd about the message--if it doesn't read like something they would have written, or seems overly eager to have you click a link--don't trust it.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Increasingly often, mobile applications on web-enabled mobile phones and tablet computers do more than they appear to.\nIn secrecy, the \"apps\" forward private data to a third party. Computer scientists from Saarbrücken have developed a new approach to prevent this data abuse. They can put a stop to the data theft through the app \"SRT AppGuard\". The chief attraction: For the protection to work, it is not necessary to identify the suspicious programs in advance, nor must the operating system be changed. Instead, the freely available app attacks the program code of the digital spies.\n\"My smartphone knows everything about me, starting with my name, my phone number, my e-mail address, my interests, up to my current location,\" explains computer science professor Michael Backes, who manages the Center for IT-Security, Privacy and Accountability at Saarland University. \"It even knows my friends quite well, as it saves their contact details, too,\" says Backes. Therefore he is not surprised that several mobile applications, also known as apps, display simple functionality up front, while in the background, they send the identification number of the device, the personal whereabouts of the user, or even the contact details of friends, colleagues and customers to a server somewhere in the internet.\nThe producers of anti-virus software have been making vivid predictions of such scenarios for some time now; in the meantime, scientific studies also prove the threat. A study from the University of California in Santa Barbara (US) concluded that among 825 examined apps for the iPhone and its operating system iOS, 21 percent forward the ID number, four percent the current position, and 0.5 percent even copy the address book.\nMichael Backes and his team of researchers now bring this abuse to an end. Their approach focuses on Android. It is the most common operating system for smartphones and tablet computers. Developed by the Google software group, this freely available operating system is used by several mobile phone manufacturers, and since November 2011 is activated daily on more than 700,000 devices.\nHowever, Android is known for its rigorous policy on assignment of privileges. If a user wants to install a downloaded app, he learns via a list which access rights to data (location, contacts, photos) and functions (Internet, locating) will be claimed by that app. Now he has two options: Either he accepts all conditions, or the app will not be installed. After the installation, the privileges cannot be revoked. \"Moreover, many developers generally claim all rights for their app because the concept of privileges of Android is misleading, but they want to ensure the smooth functioning of their app nevertheless,\" explains Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, PhD student at the chair in IT security and cryptography.\nThis \"sink-or-swim\" strategy is put to rest by the researcher from Saarbrücken. The app \"SRT AppGuard\" based on their approach determines, for every application installed on a smartphone, what it accesses, and shows this information to the user. Privileges can now be revoked or granted to the respective app at any time. The researchers have already published the app on the platform \"Google Play\". It can be downloaded there for free. It runs problem-free on Android 3.x.x and higher. The development of the app has been taken on by the enterprise Backes SRT, which was founded by Backes in 2010. It is also located on the campus in Saarbrücken.\nComputer Science on the Saarland University Campus\nApart from the Saarland University chair in computer science and the Center for IT-Security, Privacy and Accountability, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, the Max Planck Institute for Computer Science, the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the Center for Bioinformatics, the Intel Visual Computing Institute and the Cluster of Excellence on \"Multimodal Computing and Interaction\" can also be found there.\nFor their approach, the Saarbrücken researchers use the fact that the Android apps work in a so-called virtual machine, which is written in the computer language Java. Therefore the apps are saved on the smartphone as executable \"bytecode\" after installation. That's when SRT AppGuard comes into play. While the suspicious app is running, it is checking its bytecode for the security-sensitive instructions, which it had been programmed to do by the experts from Saarbrücken. It adds a special control code in front of the suspect comment or procedure. This is only necessary once, as the secured bytecode replaces the original one afterwards. This overwriting process usually only takes a few seconds and a small number of lines of additional code. The computer scientists have reviewed 13 apps, among them the popular game \"Angry Birds\", the music identifying app \"Shazam\" and the social-media apps \"Facebook\" and \"What's app\". For the app belonging to the microblogging service Twitter, for example, it needs 16.7 seconds and 48 additional lines of code. \"It is just as in an art museum ,\" explains Styp-Rekoswky, \"Instead of checking every visitor, you only provide the most valuable paintings with an invisible alarm function.\"\nBut the Saarbrücken app can do even more than just providing alerts. It is also able to block suspicious requests or change them so they cannot do any harm. \"Thus, we can also prevent the use of known security vulnerabilities of the respective apps or Android operating system,\" adds Professor Michael Backes. This possibility is very important if the manufacturer cannot provide security fixes in time,\" says the professor.\nJuly 9, 2012", "label": 1}
{"text": "HHS prescribes 11 basic steps for securing mobile devices\n- By Kathleen Hickey\n- Dec 17, 2012\nThe Health and Human Services Department, acknowledging the privacy risks when dealing with health information, has released several online resources to help health care providers protect patient privacy when using mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets and laptop PCs. The tools include videos, fact sheets and posters to educate health care professionals on how to best safeguard patient health information.\nWhile mobile devices hold promise in improving health care, “it’s important that these tools are used correctly,” said Joy Pritts, chief privacy officer for HHS’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. “Health care providers, administrators and their staffs must create a culture of privacy and security across their organizations to ensure the privacy and security of their patients’ protected health information.”\nAccording to a recent Ponemon Institute survey, negligence is the main reason for patient privacy and data breaches, with the primary cause being lost or stolen computing devices (46 percent), most of which were mobile devices. On average, 51 percent of employees are bringing their own devices to health care facilities. Ninety-four percent of the health care organizations surveyed reported a data breach in the past two years.\nOther common mobile device risks include using an unsecure Wi-Fi network; inadvertently downloading viruses or other malware; and unintentional disclosure to unauthorized users when sharing mobile devices with friends, family and/or coworkers.\nHHS recommends several policy approaches to managing mobile devices, along with 11 specific steps organizations can take, and which would apply to any public-sector agency that deals with sensitive information.\n1. Use a password or other user authentication\nConfigure mobile devices to require passwords, personal identification numbers or passcodes for access, and set the devices to lock their screens after a set period of device inactivity.\n2. Install and enable encryption\nActivate the device's built-in encryption capabilities. If no such capabilities exist, install encryption software.\n3. Install and activate remote wiping and/or remote disabling\nUse remote wiping to permanently erase data on a device that has been lost or stolen. Remote disabling can lock data, making the device usable if it is recovered.\n4. Avoid file-sharing applications\nDisable file-sharing apps that are on a device, and do not install any new ones. File-sharing software enables collaboration and the trading of files but also provides a way for unauthorized users to access mobile devices.\n5. Install and enable a firewall\nUse a personal firewall on individual devices that will detect attempts to connect and will allow or block connection based on pre-set rules.\n6.

{"text": "PreparedStatement in Java is one of several ways to execute SQL queries using JDBC API. Java provides Statement,\nPreparedStatement and CallableStatement for executing queries. Out of these three, Statement is used for general purpose queries, PreparedStatement is used for executing parametric query and CallableStatement is used for executing Stored Procedures. PreparedStatement is also a popular topic in java interviews. Questions like Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement in Java and How to prevent SQL Injection attacks in Java are popular java interview questions. In this Java JDBC tutorial we will see why should you use use PreparedStatement in Java, What are the major advantages of using PreparedStatement in Java and how PreparedStatement prevents SQL Injection attacks in Java.\nThis article is in continuation of my earlier post on database and java like 4 tips to improve performance of Java application with database and Difference between truncate and delete in SQL.If you haven’t read them already you may found those tutorial useful and interesting.\nWhat is PreparedStatement in Java\nPreparedStatement is a class in java.sql package and allows Java programmer to execute SQL queries by using JDBC package. You can get PreparedStatement object by calling connection.prepareStatement() method.SQL queries passed to this method goes to Database for pre-compilation if JDBC driver supports it. If it doesn't than pre-compilation occurs when you execute prepared queries. Prepared Statement queries are pre-compiled on database and there access plan will be reused to execute further queries which allows them to execute much quicker than normal queries generated by Statement object. Here is an example of how to use PreparedStatement in Java:\nIn this example of PreparedStatement same query and access path will be used if you pass a different parameter e.g.\n\"Standard Charted\" or \"HSBC\". ResultSet returned by prepared statement execution is of \"TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY\" but can be customized by using overloaded method of prepareStatement().\nBenefits of Java Prepared Statement\nPreparedStatement in Java JDBC offers several benefits and it’s a recommended way to execute SQL queries in any enterprise Java application or in production code. Here are few advantages of using PreparedStatement in Java:\n1. PreparedStatement allows you to write dynamic and parametric query.\nBy using PreparedStatement in Java you can write parametrized sql queries and send different parameters by using same sql queries which is lot better than creating different queries. Here is an example of parametric query written using PreparedStatement in java:\nNow you can run this query for any loan type e.g. \"personal loan”, \"home loan\" or \"gold loan\". This example of SELECT query is called parametric or parametrized query because it can be invoked with different parameter. Here “?” is used as place holder for parameter.\n2. PreparedStatement is faster than Statement in Java\nOne of the major benefits of using PreparedStatement is better performance. PreparedStatement gets pre compiled\nIn database and there access plan is also cached in database, which allows database to execute parametric query written using prepared statement much faster than normal query because it has less work to do. You should always try to use PreparedStatement in production JDBC code to reduce load on database. In order to get performance benefit its worth noting to use only parametrized version of sql query and not with string concatenation. Out of following two examples of SELECT queries, first example of SELECT query will not offer any performance benefit:\nSQL Query 1: PreparedStatement with String concatenation\nSQL Query 2: Parameterized query using PreparedStatement\nSecond SQL query is correct use of PreparedStatement in Java and give better performance than SQL query1.\n3. PreparedStatement prevents SQL Injection attacks in Java\nIf you have been working in Java web application you must be familiar with infamous SQL Injection attacks, last year Sony got victim of SQL injection and compromised several Sony play station user data. In SQL Injection attack, malicious user pass SQL meta-data combined with input which allowed them to execute sql query of there choice, If not validated or prevented before sending query to database. By using parametric queries and PreparedStatement you prevent many forms of SQL injection because all the parameters passed as part of place-holder will be escaped automatically by JDBC Driver. Though It’s worth remembering that in above example of two PreparedStatement only second example will prevent SQL injection attacks and first example is not secure with SQL injection.\n4. At last PreparedStatement queries are more readable and secure than cluttered string concatenated queries.\nLimitation of Java PreparedStatement\nDespite of being very useful PreparedStatement also has few limitations:\n1. In order to prevent SQL Injection attacks in Java, PreparedStatement doesn't allow multiple values for one placeholder (?) who makes it tricky to execute SQL query with IN clause. Following example of SQL query with IN clause using prepared Statement will not work in Java:\nThough there are some workarounds and ways to execute IN queries using PreparedStatement but those are\nrather tricky or have performance impact.\nImportant points on PreparedStatement in Java\nHere are few important points about PreparedStatement Class in Java, worth remembering:\n1. PreparedStatement in Java allows you to write parametrized query which gives better performance than Statement class in Java.\n2. In case of PreparedStatement, Database use an already compiled and defined access plan, this allows prepared statement query to run faster than normal query.\n3. Parametrized query written using PreparedStatement in Java prevents many common SQL Injection attacks.\n4. PreparedStatement allows you to write dynamic query in Java.\n5. PreparedStatement are associated with java.sql.Connection object, once you drop a connection all PreparedStatement associated with that connection will be dropped by Database.\n6. \"?\" is also called placeholder or IN parameter in Java.\n7. PreparedStatement query return FORWARD_ONLY ResultSet, so you can only move in one direction Also concurrency level of ResultSet would be \"CONCUR_READ_ONLY\".\n8. All JDBC Driver doesn't support pre compilation of SQL query in that case query is not sent to database when you call prepareStatement(..) method instead they would be sent to database when you execute PreparedStatement query.\n9. Index of placeholder or parameter starts with \"1\" and not with \"0\", which is common cause of . So in a PreparedStatement t of two placeholder, first will be referred by index 1 and second will be reference by index 2.\nThese were the reasons Why PreparedStatement in java is very popular and useful. You can still use Statement object for test programmers but consider PreparedStatement before moving to production.\nOther Java tutorials you may like", "label": 1}
{"text": "Or email safely\nOriginal article by Maurizio Antonelli\nAs well as documentation for those interested, I sincerely hope that it can raise awareness of the non-security of “electronic mail” and help users to take the appropriate implementation tools.\nLet’s start with this basic idea: “Email is not a secure media for transmitting information.”\nIn fact, almost all e-mail when traveling in the network are in clear text, without any form of encryption. As you know, an e-mail message, from the time he leave the sender PC since it arrive to the destination PC, it’s crossing different networked machines, each of which deals with “forward” it in the right direction. Whoever is at the controls of any of these machines can then view (sniff) this message, at great risk to the privacy of the sender and recipient.\nAgain: travel in clear text also UserID and Password in the process of authentication to POP3 server (incoming mail) and SMTP (outgoing mail). For this reason it is always a good idea to use the servers that provide the service to authenticate using TSL or SSL encryption in order to avoid someone take control of your e-mail.\nAnother problem: the sender of an e-mail is never guaranteed. With a few tricks you can pretend to be anyone for most of the people on the net.\nFor example with Mozilla Thunderbird. In the configuration of email accounts anybody can set up a fake sender. I can fool anyone and make them believe to be an authority, a bank or whatever. Just so I can “cheat” easily 90% -95% of users. A few will be able to notice the anomalies that are still present, however, in the headers of the mail message. With some tricks, which are not shown here, you can also lead to the disappearance of these remaining tracks … Et voila … You’re done.\nLet’s Crypt it\nLet’s start with encrypt the mail. In this way only those we want can correctly read our message.\nThe world has always been full of coding systems. The most simple anagram words, replace characters and many other methods, more or less sophisticated.\nour e-mail will travel on the network as bytes in the form of X values between 0 and 255. Substitute these values for X to X+2 values for all values of X between 0 and 253. We replace then 254 and 255 respectively with 0 and 1. We have just invented an encryption key. Only those who possess this key (because we gave it to them or because they had discovered it) will be able to understand the content of the message, others will not be able to read it.\nThe one shown above is a simple example of symmetric key encryption: the sender and receiver use the same key the first to encode and the second to decode.\nIt is a system that will not be useful for our purpose, since it ‘s not extensible to a third party. In fact, if a user A and User B are using an encryption key for their own communications, this can not be used by the user A with C. In fact, that would make decay privacy between A and B.\nIf the user A, to overcome this problem, invented and used a key to every other person he would have to handle a huge number of coding systems, and soon the system would become unmanageable.\nSolution to problem: A certificate with asymmetric key.\nWe will adopt a system that will use a certificate that consists of two distinct keys, one private and one public.\nThe private key should remain exclusively in the hands of the owner of the certificate. Should be retained with absolute attention. The owner will use it to decrypt messages that are addressed to him and more it will be used to affix a digital signature to the message which will ensure the real identity of the sender.\nThe public key may instead be distributed to the whole world, without incurring any risk of danger. It will be used to encrypt messages addressed to the owner of the certificate, only the owner of the related private key can decrypt that message. Anyone else see a number of bytes/characters without any meaning. In addition, it will be used to verify the digital signature that has been affixed with the private key.\nThe public key can be distributed to anyone without control. The fact that fall into foreign hands will not constitute any danger. The greatest attention should be given exclusively to the private key, which must remain strictly in the hands of the legitimate owners. If it does not fall into foreign hands, the system will be 100% safe (although in many mathematics departments are continuing to check the security of this solution).\nLet’s try to understand how to operate an asymmetric key certificate. The following example is not applicable for those who will be our aim, however, gives a clear idea of how in mathematics exist non bijective functions that fit for purpose.\nImagine having to give these data: 4, -2, -1 and 5. Now the public key, which encrypts the sequence of four numbers, will consist in raising the square each. This will give us: 16, 4, 1 and 25. Another user who has in his hand only the public key can decrypt the data? The answer is no. In fact, information from the first number: 16. We know from the public key, that the number is the result of a number that was squared. Reverse: the square root, but the square root of 16 is not unique. 4 is a result yes, but it is also -4. How do we know which one to take? With only the public key we cannot.\nAs mentioned above, this example can not be used: the process of encryption is too simple to be efficient, but makes a very good idea of how more complex math functions not reversible, can be used for our purpose.\nFinding function much more fit, I can reach my goal: to create a certificate key-pair with which to encrypt with the public and be able to decrypt only with the private.\nAt this point, l’ll distribute the public key and anyone can encrypt messages they want to send to me. Only and only I, holder of the related private key, can decipher the e-mail.\nNow we see another possible use of an asymmetric key certificate. Imagine you can make a transaction using the private key on a message written by me. This operation, taking account of the sender and every single character that makes up the message, will give a unique result that can be obtained exclusively if that has been carried out with my private key. The result is a kind of checksum, because it takes into account all the individual bytes that make up the mail. If the sender had a different character or whether one was different, the checksum is different.\nHolders of public key can not do the same with the same results, however, they may conduct an audit to check that the result may have produced solely and exclusively by the owner of the private key associated with it.\nI just found a way to digitally sign my message: it was definitely sent by the owner of the private key, in addition, through the checksum, I can be sure that during his trip, the mail has not undergone any change of any kind, even 1 character has not changed.\nNow there is a little attention to maintain. I will have to distribute my public key. there are 3 way to do this meeting in person “face to face”, even through the key-party, the meetings organized to exchange public keys, I can put on my personal website, or there are available key-server where everyone can put your public key and where users can do research, as if the were online lists. The thing to check in all cases is that the public key is really associated to the person you think. If i’m sure that a key come from a guy, but in reality it is from another person, the authentication system has been seriously compromised.\nWhen possible exchange of key is always better when done in person. Even a website can give assurances, for example, who knows me, knows that maury.it is my site, and then follows that the key is on http://www.maury.it/gpg I had entered it there, so it is mine but in all other cases, authentication, face to face is the surest guarantee.\nI personally always carry in my pocket a note written the code of my certificate GnuPG: 0x51F1316C. In this way, anyone who meets me may ask me the code and check it, so that he could verify the one on my website, on a key-server or on my e-mail signed (many times I had attached the public key) is really mine; Once the authentication is done by me in person, he can be pretty sure that the certificate is really mine.\nLet’s see now how to obtain a digital certificate.\nSome companies issue certificates according to the standard S/MIME. This standard is supported natively by most email clients, so you will not need to install plug-ins and/or additional extensions.\nThe first company that i want to report is Thawte. it’s from South Africa and issues free certificates for personal use. Thawte, with the classic system of “Reply to this e-mail …” can verify the authenticity of your e-mail address. For the identity registry, in order to submit the certificate that is your name and your last name, use the system of notaries: the Web Of Trust. People thought to be reliable and authenticated by the company (public notaries) is delegated to give a score from 10 to 35, depending on your length of service, having personally verified the identity of a new user.\nA user, reaching 50 points, is declared authenticated by Thawte and then he will have his name entered in the certificate. Upon reaching the 100 points it enter in the notaries and it can then authenticate other users. Of course, the identity registry system is subject to the seriousness of notaries for the truthfulness of the email address you must, instead, to trust Thawte, a company that will act as guarantor.\nThawte notaries are now all over the world, some authenticate for free, others require small sum, on the Thawte website you can find the one closer to your area. If anyone needs, I am a notary and, knowing other notaries, i can get the authentication on the fly, totally free, because I like disclosure of information and security for pure passion.\nOther Digital certificates are awarded by Italian companies like GeoTrust, the Italian Post Office and several banks. GeoTrust certificates are also released free for personal use. The others, however, as a paid service: at the offices there will be the authentication procedure and then the software will be released containing the certificate in the appropriate CD-ROM.\nWith this system, the digital signature is enhanced by the recognized authority. Thawte is recognized worldwide from several years. The others, however, may have less confidence abroad: I do not know how much credibility can have, for example, in Canada a certified mail by an authority like the Italian Post.\nThis system of authority may not be the one i was searching for: I want to be the sole guarantor of my identity. So I need a tool to create a digital certificate with an asymmetric key. Here come GnuPG.\nEnd of the first part of this interesting article, in the second part it will be explained in detail the use of GPG with email.\n- Nightingale a Beautiful music player for Linux\n- Livarp – A lightweight Linux Distribution\n- Linux shell: Dfc – Check your disk space with style\n- How to convert YouTube Video to MP3 easily on GNU/Linux\n- 5 Comic Book Viewers for Linux", "label": 1}
{"text": "Here are some things to be aware of.\n1) Your password. Do you ever find it hard to manage your passwords? most of us do! It's important to have a robust password that is hard to guess--so it shouldn't be your name, your birthday, or anything obvious. The best passwords have a mixture of words and letters, and are at least 8 characters long. To make it unbreakable, consider using simple substitutions: 1 for I, 3 for E, 5 for S, 0 for O, @ for a. Thus, for example, the word \"Christian\" could be written \"Chr15t1@n\". (That's still a pretty obvious word, so I'd try something more obscure, like the name of your first grade teacher).\nDon't use the same password for \"mission critical\" online experiences (e.g., online banking, anything linked to your credit card) and more lightweight applications (facebook). You might also consider setting up a second email address, using one of the free providers (gmail, yahoo, hotmail) to use when you sign up for something, to keep your real address more secure and spam free.\nExperts say that if you have a robust password, and you guard it carefully, you don't need to change it very frequently. But that assumes that you are careful where you use it. So beware of\n2) Phishing. This is the name given to a wide variety of cons that try to get you to enter your username and password on a fake site, so that they can get access to your email, your bank, or your facebook. Generally, this is done by sending you a message, like an email, that has a link in it. The source appears trustworthy--your bank, a good friend--but is almost always \"spoofed\", or pretending to be from someone it's not. They may try to panic you (your account is being closed down!) or offer you a great deal (free supercomputer giveaway!) but don't fall for it. The link they want you to click may LOOK realistic but is usually coded \"under the hood\" to take you to a fake site. You may not even notice, when you click on it, that the address in the browser menu bar isn't the same as your bank's.\nThe solution? Always assume links in an email or a facebook message are tricks, and never, ever enter user information or password on a site you have reached by clicking on an email. Better yet, don't click on links in an email.\nIf you want to reach your bank, never \"click through\" from the email, but type in the correct address--less convenient, but reliable. Be suspicious--your bank or your internet provider will never send you an email asking you for your password, so if you get such an email, it's always fake. And if you click a link to a site that should be secure, look for the \"https\" in front of the address in your browser's menubar--indicating a secure connection. (And make sure the address is correct-- website.com is NOT the same as website.biz, and mybank.com.ru is not mybank.com!!)\n3)Facebook scams. When you choose to go on facebook, you are putting a lot of information out there--some of which is a gold mine for those more ethically challenged. Facebook defaults to expose most of your information to the public at large. Use the Accounts>privacy menu in your profile to restrict who can see what. For example, do friends of your friends need to know your birthdate, particularly the year? Does the world need that info? Err on the side of security and hide it. Remember, phishing can occur here too--messages aren't always from whom they claim to be. (And just because Facebook ASKS you for your hometown, doesn't mean you have to tell them.)\nA major problem with facebook is the facebook apps -- you know, the quizzes, games, and other links that pop up now and again. You may not even notice when you do a facebook quiz or click an online offer that you are also clicking something that says, \"allow Quizmondo to access your user settings\" which could give them access to your wall and your friends' walls. Moreover, if you allow your friends full access to your info, the apps that THEY choose may see more than you like on YOUR wall. If you have 300+ friends, do you really trust all of them to make wise decisions with your info? Consider how much of it they need to know.\nBy the way, there's an odd tendency to think that the only people who see what you post on Facebook are your actual friends. Remember that if you post something on a friend's wall, all THEIR friends see it too. Facebook allows you to message someone privately; consider doing that, if you want to give them your unlisted phone number or tell them how many weeks you'll be out of the country, rather than post it on their wall.\nFinally, you can ask Facebook to use a higher level of security (https). It will also monitor what computer you use to log in, and tell you if a log in occurs from a different computer. Go to account>account settings>account security to set this up.\n4. Gmail It turns out that Gmail is also susceptible to scams where unscrupulous vendors can gain access to your account and send emails in your name, which then attack the recipients. I think to most of us, it's a surprise that Gmail allows anyone to gain access the way Facebook does! The most notorious recently is something called \"ShoppyBag\" in which an email from a friend promised you a photograph.. Again, the usual rule holds true: don't open it if you don't know what it is regardless of who sent it. You can always contact your friend and ask what it is! And as with Facebook, check your Gmail settings regularly to make sure your account isn't compromised.\n- Sign in on the Google Accounts homepage.\n- Click the 'My Account' link displayed at the top right of the page.\n- Click 'Authorizing Applications & Sites'. This page will list all third-party sites you've granted access to.\n- Click the 'Revoke Access' link to disable access for a site.\nConclusion: You can have a pretty safe on-line life if you maintain a healthy skepticism. Most free offers are probably too good to be true. Guard your passwords, and when in doubt, err on the side of caution. It can be a mean online world out there, but with a little care you can keep on the light side.\nSusan Forsburg is the Cathedral blogmaster and an internet geek.

{"text": "Editor's note: Marc Goodman is a global security adviser and futurist. He is the founder of the Future Crimes Institute and serves as Chair of Policy, Law & Ethics at Silicon Valley's Singularity University. He spoke at TED Global in June 2012. TED is a nonprofit dedicated to \"Ideas worth spreading,\" which it makes available through talks posted on its website.\n(CNN) -- The future of science and technology sounds so promising. Unprecedented advances in computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, neuroscience and biotechnology hold the potential to radically transform our world for the better and create mass abundance for all.\nI sincerely want to believe in this techno-utopian vision of things to come, but my work as a police officer and global security strategist working in more than 70 countries around the world has taught me that there is a darker side to these emerging technologies.\nThe criminal underground is highly innovative and often acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. As a young police officer, I observed gang members and drug dealers using beepers and mobile phones, long before they were in common use by the general public. Today, criminals are even building their own encrypted radio communications networks, such as the nationwide system developed by narco cartels in Mexico.\nTechnology has made our world increasingly open, and for the most part that has huge benefits for society. Nevertheless, all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Take, for example, the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai, India. The perpetrators were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. The lethal innovation was the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies, including smartphones, satellite imagery and night-vision goggles to locate additional victims and slaughter them.\nMoreover, the terrorists created their own operations center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored global news broadcasts, online reporting and social media in real time, leveraging the public's photos, videos and social network updates to kill more people.\nThe terrorists in the Mumbai incident even used search engines during their attack to identify individual hostages and to determine, based upon their backgrounds, who should live or and who should die. These innovations gave terrorists unprecedented situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and the government.\nNewer forms of technology are also subject to criminal misuse. Robots are becoming more commonplace, and international organized crime groups and terrorists have lost no time in deploying these technologies as part of their field operations. For example, drug traffickers in Latin America are using robotic submarines to deliver thousands of tons of cocaine annually to the United States.\nLast year, the FBI arrested a man in Boston who planned to use remote-controlled robotic aircraft packed with explosives to attack both the U.S. Pentagon and Capitol building. In the future, as robots become more widely deployed, so too could their criminal use and exploitation.\nAdvances in the life sciences means it is now possible to design DNA on a computer screen and send the DNA code to a \"bio printer\" for assembly. Our ability to reprogram DNA itself will undoubtedly lead to great advances in medicine, but the danger is that these same techniques can be used to modify viruses, like H5N1 influenza, to become more and more lethal, potentially affecting millions around the globe. To hackers, DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked.\nWe are at the dawn of an exponentially advancing technological arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill.\nThough such battles have gone on since the beginning of time, what has changed is the pace of innovation. New technologies and capabilities are emerging so quickly, it becomes increasingly likely they will outpace the capabilities of public safety officials to respond. The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.\nTechnology is proliferating at an exponential pace and despite law enforcement's best efforts, cybercrime grows unabated. In coming years, we will witness an explosion in the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and synthetic biology. There is little to suggest police will be any more prepared for these emerging threats than they were for basic cyber crimes.\nOur current nation-based legal and policing paradigms have clearly not kept pace with the global threat. The paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism call for a shift to a more open and participatory form of law enforcement.\nGiven the rapid acceleration of technological development, any system that relies on a small, elite force of highly trained government agents may be doomed to failure. Good people in the world far outnumber those with ill intentions. But criminals and terrorists have shown their ability to take up technological arms to harm the general populace. This calls for increased vigilance on the part of ordinary citizens.\nThe tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us.\nFollow @CNNOpinion on Twitter\nJoin us at Facebook/CNNOpinion\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc Goodman.", "label": 1}

It is not a complete guide by any stretch of the imagination, and it assumes that the reader is comfortable with using C on a Linux platform.\nProcessing XML with Perl\nPerl has an unparalleled wealth of XML support, but where do you start? Can you tell a twig from a tree? Can you see the DOM for the groves? Read on to find out which Perl module to use for your XML processing.\nExploring parsing and virtual machines with Python\nThe design of compilers/interpreters is a challenging field -- one which offers a lot of scope for theoretical exploration as well as hands on coding. Being a Python fan, I tried to implement some of the ideas which I am learning about compilers/interpreters in this beautiful language. As I am neither a Python Guru nor a compiler expert, the implementation may be imperfect. But it was certainly lots of fun!\nWant to know what some of the top people in the community are thinking about? Here are two recent interviews, one with Alan Cox (kernel hacker) and Linus Torvalds (no introduction needed), and one with David Whitinger (founder of Linsight.com).\nInterview with Linus Torvalds and Alan Cox\n32 Bits Online interviews Linus Torvalds and Alan Cox in An exclusive interview with Linus \"Linux\" Torvalds and Alan \"Kernel Hacker\" Cox.\" This interview was held over the weekend of March 25 in Austin, Texas.

{"text": "The cloud holds many promises for companies, such as the possibility of optimizing costs by paying for computing resources on an “on-demand” basis, improved reliability, lower administration costs, and others still. At the same time, many issues still remain. There is still a lot of confusion related to the security of cloud solutions, both in terms of data security, that is, the capacity of cloud providers to protect their customer’s data, as well as in terms of legal security for the stored information, which is the compliance with legislation (many times from multiple countries) and the legal risks associated with it.\nWhile many different areas from IT can benefit from employing the cloud, for many different reasons, there are some use cases where cloud computing fits particularly well. These cases represent situations where the benefits from adopting a cloud solution clearly outweigh the potential risks associated with it, and are the use cases that many companies are choosing to experiment with in the cloud.\nThe first case where the cloud - mostly cloud servers - is being heavily used is for application testing. Developers have been using virtual machines to simulate different execution environments for quite some time already, but the cloud allows them to do this on a much greater scale. By creating virtual machine images that simulate the final production environment, any developer can quickly spin up a test machine, deploy their projects to them, and run “live” tests on a separate environment, without having to rely on running virtual machines on their own PC, or even on the corporate data center.\nThe public cloud infrastructure is very interesting in this case because it is a very low-cost alternative. With a few dollars, anyone can spin up servers with multiple hardware / software configurations to test applications under different environments. It also allows controlled testing of large-scale distributed applications, which would be much harder under conventional circumstances.\nSince the data being used for application testing isn’t (or at least, shouldn’t be) real customer data, the risk of data theft or of infringing some legislation regarding where data may or may not be stored is minimal. And since the test servers can be spun up for a test run, and then shut down, companies can greatly benefit from cost optimizations by moving their test environments to the cloud.\nApplication contingency is another area where the cloud shines. The ability to quickly replicate virtual machine images across different regions creates the possibility for companies to maintain very low-cost contingency infrastructures. If something goes wrong with the main site - a hardware failure, network connectivity problems, even software crashes - new instances of the application servers can be spun up in alternative locations, minimizing application downtime. This means that anyone can have a good contingency plan without much investment in infrastructure, and without having to actually pay for the contingency at all times.\nAnother possible scenario is to keep multiple servers running in geographically disperse regions. Most companies don’t have access to multiple datacenters at different locations internally, and here is where public cloud infrastructure can really help. All the top cloud infrastructure providers offer multiple datacenter locations where servers can be replicated, so it becomes easy to spin up servers in different places. They also offer load balancers and dynamic IPs that can be shared across servers, making contingency that much easier.\nFinally, contingency doesn’t apply only to disaster cases. Companies can use cloud infrastructure to deploy contingencies for situations where they need more computing power, such as handling peak loads that only happen sporadically. An e-commerce website that has a huge peak of visitors during the Christmas season could run cloud servers to balance out its load only during this time of the year, reducing total cost.\nWhile the risks in this usage scenario are greater, the potential benefits still outweigh them. Most companies can use the cloud to create a much stronger contingency plan than they would be able to relying only on their own infrastructure. There are also several strategies and tools that can be employed to mitigate the associated risks, ranging from data encryption to simply hosting the data separately from the application that is making use of it, on a more secure environment.\n“Big” data processing\nWhile there isn’t a very clear definition of what exactly constitutes “Big Data” and what doesn’t, companies can benefit from employing the cloud to do massive parallel processing of large quantities of data. For organizations that need to crunch massive amounts of data, the cloud brings the possibility to deploy huge numbers of servers for the task. In fact, many cloud providers are already offering servers or services based on the most commonly used tools for Big Data tasks, such as Hadoop.\nEven companies that don’t have petabytes of data to process every day can benefit from using the cloud for their processing needs. By deploying servers on an on-demand basis, they fine tune their processing jobs with respect to cost vs. execution time. Furthermore, relying on outside infrastructure means a much smaller initial investment in hardware (even if total costs may be higher in the long run), as well as no excess capacity. They can pay only for what they use, and nothing else.\nThis is the scenario with the largest risks. Companies looking to move processing loads to the cloud must carefully consider the nature of the processing job they want to run as well as the nature of the data being processed, and the risk of this data being stolen. At the same time, the potential benefits are great. For small companies that can’t afford to build their own infrastructure, the cloud gives the opportunity to do much more than what was possible before.\nAs with any other technology, there are places where the cloud shines and offers great benefits and others where that isn’t quite true. The scenarios compiled here are the top use cases where I’ve seen companies employing cloud computing, especially cloud servers. This list, however, is far from complete. It was built from personal experience, without relying on any kind of poll. If you have any other interesting cloud use cases, please share in the comments or let me know.", "label": 1}
{"text": "A virulent and widespread computer virus was found on Friday, March 26, 1999. This virus has spread all over the globe within just hours of the initial discovery, apparently spreading faster than any other virus before.\nMelissa works with Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Outlook 97 or 98 e-mail client. You don't need to have Microsoft Outlook to receive the virus in e-mail, but it will not spread itself further without it.\nMelissa will not work under Word 95 and will not spread further under Outlook Express.\nMelissa can infect Windows 95, 98, NT and Macintosh users. If the infected machine does not have Outlook or internet access at all, the virus will continue to spread locally within the user's own documents.\nThe details below refer to the Melissa.A variant.\nThe virus spreads by e-mailing itself automatically from one user to another. When the virus activates it modifies user's documents by inserting comments from the TV series \"The Simpsons\". Even worse, it can send out confidential information from the computer without users' notice.\nThe virus was discovered on Friday, late evening in Europe, early morning in the US. For this reason, the virus spread in the USA during Friday. Many multinational companies reported widespread infections, including Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft closed down their whole e-mail system to prevent any further spreading of the virus. The number of infected computers is estimated to be tens of thousands so far and it is rising quickly.\n\"We've never seen a virus spread so rapidly,\" comments Mikko Hypponen, F-Secure's Manager of Anti-Virus Research. \"We've seen a handful of viruses that distribute themselves automatically over e-mail, but not a single one of them has been as successful as Melissa in the real world.\"\n\"The virus won't spread much during this weekend. We will see the real problem on Monday morning\", continues Hypponen. \"When a big company gets infected, their e-mail servers are seriously slowed down and might even crash, as people start to e-mail large document attachments without realising it.\"\nFor more information on Melissa, see Global Melissa Information Center at http://www.F-Secure.com/melissa/\nMelissa was initially distributed in an internet discussion group called alt.sex. The virus was sent in a file called LIST.DOC, which contained passwords for X-rated websites.\nWhen users downloaded the file and opened it in Microsoft Word, a macro inside the document executed and e-mailed the LIST.DOC file to 50 people listed in the user's e-mail alias file (\"address book\").\nThe e-mail looked like this:\n- From: (name of infected user)\n- Subject: Important Message From (name of infected user)\n- To: (50 names from alias list)\n- Body: Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)\n- Attachment: LIST.DOC\nDo notice that Melissa can arrive in any document, not necessarily just in this LIST.DOC where it was spread initially.\nMost of the recipients are likely to open a document attachment like this, as it usually comes from someone they know.\nAfter sending itself out, the virus continues to infect other Word documents. Eventually, these files can end up being mailed to other users as well. This can be potentially disastrous, as a user might inadvertently send out confidential data to outsiders.\nThe virus activates if it is executed when the minutes of the hour match the day of the month; for example, 18:27 on the 27th day of a month. At this time the virus will insert the following phrase into the current open document in Word:\n- \"Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here\".\nThis text, as well as the alias name of the author of the virus, \"Kwyjibo\", are all references to the popular cartoon TV series called \"The Simpsons\". For more information on this connection, see this Simpsons web page:\nThe main difference between Melissa.I and Melissa.A is that this variant uses a random number to select subject lines and message bodies of outgoing messages from eight different alternatives:\n1. Subject: Question for you...\nIt's fairly complicated so I've attached it.\n2. Subject: Check this!!\nThis is some wicked stuff!\n3.

Subject: * Free Downloads\nHere is a list of sites where you can obtain Free Downloads.\nIn the last subject, the asterisk will be replaced with a random character.\nUnlike Melissa.A, this variant uses a different registry key (called \"Empirical\") to check whenever mass mailing has been done.\nMelissa.I contains an additional payload as well. If the number of minutes equals the number of hours, the virus inserts the following text to the active document:\n- All empires fall, you just have to know where to push.\nAt the same time, the virus clears the mark from the registry causing the mass mail part to be reactivated a soon as a document is opened or closed, a new document is created or the Word is restarted.\nThis Melissa variant sends itself to 100 recipients from each Outlook address book. The E-mail looks like this:\n- Subject: Duhalde Presidente\n- Body: Programa de gobierno 1999 - 2004.\nW97M/Melissa.U is a similar to Melissa.A. Unlike Melissa.A, this variant uses the module name \"Mmmmmmm\" and it has a destructive payload. This variant deletes the following system files:\nTo do this, the virus removes hidden, system, read-only and archive attributes from these files. Unlike W97M/Melissa.A, it sends itself only to 4 recipients. The message itself is also different:\n- Subject: pictures (user name)\n- Body: what's up ?\nWhere (user name) is replaced with Word's registered user name.\nThe following texts will be added to every infected document:\n- Loading... No\n- >>>>Please Check Outlook Inbox Mail<<<<<\nThis variant has been detected since October 13th, 1999.\nThis variant is similar to Melissa.U. This variant sends itself to 40 recipients and the message is different:\n- Subject: My pictures (user name)\nThe message body is empty, and (user name) is replaced with Word's registered user name. After Melissa.V has mailed itself, it will delete all files from the root of the following drives:\nWhen this has been done, the virus shows a message box with the following text:\n- Hint: Get Norton 2000 not McAfee 4.02\nThis variant has been detected since October 13th, 1999.\nMelissa.W does not lower macro security settings in Word 2000. Otherwise it is functionally equal with Melissa.A.\nMelissa.AO uses Outlook to send e-mail message with:\n- Subject: Extremely URGENT: To All E-Mail User -\n- Body: This announcement is for all E-MAIL user. Please take\nnote that our E-Mail Server will down and we\nrecommended you to read the document which attached\nwith this E-Mail.\nThe payload activates at 10 am on 10th day of each month when the virus inserts the following text to the active document:", "label": 1}

{"text": "(De Montford University, Leichester, UK) Patients recovering from surgery get infections far more often than is being reported, a new study led by De Montfort University has found. Infection prevention specialists are now calling on the Department of Health to bring in a clear and standardized system for hospitals to try to identify the true scale of surgical infections. They say a study of the way in which NHS hospital trusts in England has shown \"worrying inconsistencies\" between hospitals in how they defined surgical site infections and how rigorously they looked for them. As a result, published infection rates for hospitals do not always give a true picture.\nThe reasons hospitals gave for not submitting data was that the surveillance system was flawed and unwieldy and they didn't trust the system. Their paper, published today in the Journal of Hospital Infection, casts further doubt on the reliability of the national surgical site infection surveillance scheme in England. Lead researcher Professor Judith Tanner of De Montfort University said \"The national SSI surveillance system in England consistently under-reports the true scale of surgical infection and gives a false sense of security. This study shows there are so many inconsistencies that it's not possible to benchmark hospitals against the English national surgical site infection data\".\nSpecialists at De Montfort University, Leicester; Southport and Newcastle-upon-Tyne universities sent out a questionnaire to all 156 NHS hospital trusts in England asking how they collected and reported data on post-operative wound infection for the national surgical site infection surveillance scheme. Replies were received from 106 (68%). The results showed worrying inconsistencies between hospitals. For example, trusts which actively extended their surveillance to patients who had had knee replacement, after they had been discharged from hospital, reported an infection rate of 4.1 percent; hospitals that did not look so hard reported a lower rate, 1.5 percent.\nThe authors suggested that in order to identify the true scale of surgical infections, hospitals should contact every single patient, by letter or phone within 30 days after surgery. Professor Tanner said: \"The harder you look, the more that you find. Common sense tells you this and now we have demonstrated that with this study. Perversely, hospitals that conduct robust and high quality surveillance are penalized under the current system\".\nSurgical infection rates reported by the scheme were often noticeably lower than rates reported from published research studies. In 2009, after reviewing the scheme, the Public Accounts Committee concluded that the Department of Health did not have an understanding of the true scale of SSIs in England because of a lack of decent data. Examples include:\n- 10 percent of hospitals did not provide data on superficial infection.\n- Five percent did not use the HPA's standardised definition of wound infection.\n- There were significant differences in how hard Trusts looked for infection.\n- Only 9/106 hospitals looked for early infections developing before patients left the hospital.\n- 24/106 hospitals only included patients while they were in hospital, and if they happened to be re-admitted with a wound infection.\n- 73/106 hospitals used in-patient, re-admission follow up, and actively looked for infections by directly contacting patients after they had been discharged from the hospital.", "label": 1}

{"text": "(BPT) - When it comes to your health, the old adage, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” still rings true. It’s doubly valid when you’re talking about the health of your digital and financial identity. Giving your identity a checkup is every bit as important as getting your annual physical and flu shot, or exercising regularly to maintain good health.\nYet many people avoid delving into the health of their financial identity – perhaps for the same reason that some people avoid medical exams. A checkup, while meant to confirm that everything is fine, can potentially turn up a problem – and no one likes bad news.\nBut avoiding or ignoring bad news doesn’t make it go away. Just ask the members of the nearly 9 million households that experienced identity theft in 2010, the most recent year for which the Bureau of Justice Statistics has published numbers.\nWhile you may already know that keeping an eye on your credit is an essential part of identity theft protection, it’s not the only step you need to take. Here are five important things everyone should do in order to give themselves an identity check up:\n1. Google your own name – What do you find? You may be amazed at how many hits the search engine returns, and just where on the Internet your name shows up. Is the information correct? Is any of it too personally revealing – does it include your address or telephone number? Take steps to correct inaccuracies and if your name appears on a particularly disturbing website, try to have it removed.\n2. Review your social networking accounts – In August, Facebook revealed that more than 83 million user accounts are fake or duplicates. It’s almost certain that identity thieves are among those users falsifying information as social networks can be a gold mine of personal information for crooks. To protect your information, use the most restrictive privacy settings provided by the social media sites you frequent. Turn off tools that allow the site to track your browsing history, and never accept a “friend” request from someone you don’t personally know.\n3. Change your passwords – Many of us access accounts online that are password protected – from bank and investment accounts to social media and even health care provider websites. Always use strong passwords that include lowercase and capital letters, numbers and symbols (whenever possible) and change your passwords regularly.\n4. Keep an eye on your credit – Checking your credit report once a year is no longer sufficient. This task is as much about managing your identity as it is about managing your personal credit.

{"text": "How to Fix a Windows Infection Using Linux\nIf you use Linux on your company's desktop or server computers, you're already familiar with many of the security advantages the open source operating system offers over its Windows and Mac rivals. What many people don't realize, however, is that Linux can also be used to rescue a computer that has been crippled by malware.\nMalware is a frequent occurrence in the Windows world, in particular, and it can be devastating. When a Windows virus strikes, not only can it become difficult or even impossible to continue using the affected machine, but it can be dangerous as well, since prolonged use can further the infection.\nThat's where Linux can be a life-saver. Without ever having to install the free alternative, you can still use it temporarily on a PC to get rid of any infection. Here's how.\n1. Get a LiveCD or Live USB\nLiveCDs and USBs are a wonderful thing in the Linux world because they let you boot a machine directly from the CD or USB stick without ever having to access the computer's boot records. Not only are they a great way to take Linux for a test-drive, but they can also be put to work when Windows can't.\nBy far the fastest way to get a LiveCD or USB is to download the .iso file of the Linux distribution you'd like to use and then burn it onto a CD or USB stick. Since Ubuntu is the most popular distribution out there, I'll go with Maverick Meerkat--the latest version of the software--for this example.\nUbuntu can be downloaded from the project's Website for use on a LiveCD or USB; download links for other distributions can be found listed on FrozenTech. UNetbootin is another nice option if you want to go the USB route, which tends to run much faster.\nOf course, to take either of these options you'll have to have a working, Internet-connected computer. If you don't, or if your Internet connection is slow, you may want to order a LiveCD or USB via snail mail. OSDisc and LinuxCD both offer a variety of options; pricing is about $2.\n2. Boot into Linux\nOnce you're equipped with a Linux LiveCD or USB, you'll need to make sure the infected computer is turned off, and then turn it on again with the CD or USB installed. This will boot the computer into Linux, completely bypassing Windows and its infection. Again, nothing has been installed -- you're simply using Linux to get the machine running reliably again.\n3. Get Antivirus Software\nNext it's time to get the Linux-based ammunition you'll need to wipe out the malware: antivirus software. I'm going to use ClamAV, my favorite, via ClamTK, which provides a nice graphical front end.\nFrom the main Ubuntu desktop, then, go to \"Applications\" and then \"Ubuntu Software Center.\" Choose \"Edit\" and then \"Software Sources.\" You'll be presented with a box entitled, \"Downloadable from the Internet,\" and you should be sure all four boxes are checked before you click on \"Close.\"\nNext, from the main Ubuntu Software Center page, click on the \"Accessories\" icon and type ClamTK into the search box. It will be shown as \"Virus Scanner,\" but if you click on \"More Info\" you can verify it's the right package. Click \"Install\" and wait for it to download.\nOnce installation is finished, you should launch ClamTK by going to \"Applications\" in Ubuntu's main menu, then \"Accessories\" and \"Virus Scanner,\" which is how the software will still be shown.\n4. Run a Scan\nWhen the ClamTK window opens, click on the \"Scan\" tab and select the option for a Recursive Scan. Next, you'll need to tell the software which drive you want to check for viruses, which in this case is the one that includes Windows. Scanning may take some time, but once the infection is found you'll get the usual options for what to do with it, including quarantine and removal.\n5. Return to Normal\nAssuming the infection has now been removed, your computer should be clean once again, making it safe to remove the LiveCD or USB and boot back into Windows as usual. As you enjoy your malware-free machine once again, remember that it's all thanks to Linux. It's also not a bad idea to keep your LiveCD or USB handy so you'll be ready for the next time.\nFollow Katherine Noyes on Twitter: @Noyesk.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Zombies join the attack\nFor years they've worked in separate corners of the electronic world. Virus writers exploited computers for fun or curiosity or out of sheer malice. Spammers tried to bypass email filters to place unsolicited commercial advertisements in email inboxes.\nNow they're working together.\nInfecting personal computers has evolved into a lucrative industry. The emerging alliance between spammers, virus writers and even organised criminals threatens to make personal computer users unwitting parties to online crime.\nFormerly viruses carried a single hit or \"payload\" programmed to do anything from displaying an ironic or playful message on a user's screen to the more malicious actions of viruses such as the Gigger worm, which wreaked havoc with a hard drive. Once it had achieved its purpose, the virus would replicate and spread, having done its damage.\nNow, however, a new breed of virus is taking a more sophisticated and destructive approach. Viruses now seek to embed themselves on personal computers, creating security holes on individual PCs and allowing them to be controlled by hackers over the internet.\n\"What we're seeing now is a change in what viruses are aiming to do,\" says John Donovan, the managing director of Symantec Australia. \"A number of years ago programmers of malicious code would attempt to attack a system; now they try to compromise the security of a computer for personal gain.\"\nVirus writers target unprotected home computers, looking to bypass their security systems and take control of computer activity.\n\"The issue is average home users don't have the level of protection they need to secure their computers,\" says Allan Bell of McAfee Asia-Pacific, which makes anti-virus software. \"They don't see their machine as being a target for hackers. But just because they don't have valuable data on their machine doesn't mean that a hacker won't open up their computer.\"\nThe infected PCs or \"zombies\" are hijacked by internet criminals. \"These zombie computers are used by hackers to then do further damage,\" says Bell.\nVirus writers try to connect the PCs they've infected into networks or \"botnets\". Botnets usually consist of infected Windows PCs networked via the internet, ranging in size from 10,000 up to 100,000 PCs.\nOnce the botnet is established, virus makers can then lease access to email spammers. Sales are conducted via instant messaging programs and can fetch between $65 and $130 for an hour of access.\nSpammers will then use these infected computers to send millions of unsolicited messages in just a few hours, preferring to use networks because it makes it harder for recipients to block the emails and it protects the spammer's identity.\nThe unprotected users whose machines are being harnessed often don't notice the activity, with most hackers concealing their intrusions. \"This represents the biggest risk - people being infected but not knowing that they're being infected,\" Donovan says.\nThe chances of the average PC user becoming infected are increasing. Symantec estimates that Australia is fourth in the world in the level of PC virus infection, behind the US, Canada and China. The proliferation of viruses and the sophistication and power of virus code is attributed to an intricate global network of virus writers.\n\"We can see through things like the development of virus programs, from early scares like the  Michelangelo right through to the recent Sasser virus, that the newer versions have multiple additions to the code, making them more sophisticated and harder to detect, which points to a fairly well-developed network of people who are developing [the viruses],\" Donovan says.\nAuthorities are struggling to keep track of the fast-growing criminal industry. Virus writers have a diverse physical presence, with hot spots ranging from Russia to Indonesia and even the US. The only step that can be taken against the mounting threat is an awareness of the risk. \"The challenge is not a lack of anti-virus technology; it is understanding how to use that technology,\" Donovan says.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Back It Up\nProtect yourself against data loss by making electronic copies of important files, commonly referred to as a backup.\nOur computers contain vast amounts of data, from family photos and music collections to financial records and personal contacts. In fact, a recent National Cyber Security Alliance/Symantec study found that more than 68% of Americans store more the 25% of their photos digitally. For most people, the loss of that information could be devastating.\nData can be lost in several ways: computer malfunctions, theft, viruses, spyware, accidental deletion, and natural disasters.\nData backup is a simple, three step process:\nMake Copies of Your DataMany computers come with a backup software program installed, so check to see if you have one. Most backup software programs will allow you to make copies of every file and program on your computer, or just the files you’ve changed since your last backup.\nHere are links to backup utilities in popular operating systems:\nSelect Hardware to Store Your DataWhen you conduct a backup, the files will have to be stored on a physical device - such as CDs, DVDs, or USB flash drives, an external hard drive, or on the web using cloud-based online storage.\nSafely Store the Backup Device that Holds Your DataAfter setting up the software and copying your files on a regular basis, make sure you keep your backup device somewhere safe. Some ideas include a trusted neighbor’s house, your workplace, a safe, or a secure place at home that would likely survive a natural disaster. Keep your backup device close enough so that you can retrieve it easily when you do your regular backup.\nOther software programs are available for purchase if your system does not have a backup program or if you’re seeking other features.

{"text": "You know how it works. Your end users visit an infected site and inadvertently download the latest type of malware. If your antivirus software is up to snuff, it will prevent the download or, at the very least, locate and isolate the invading file on the user's hard drive. But what if there is no file on the hard drive to detect? What if instead the malware resides only in memory, running under a trusted process that you, the antivirus software and the operating system itself assume cannot be breached?\nThat's exactly what happened in Russia earlier this year, when more than 300,000 computers were infected with a unique type of malware -- the fileless bot. After the bot ran unencumbered for several months, Kaspersky Lab announced that it had discovered a rare type of infection being propagated through Russian online information resources. Advertisements supplied to the sites by AdFox, a third-party ad network, contained Java malware that directed browsers to a download server run by cybercriminals.\nHow the fileless bot works\nStep 1: Users visit the infected site. They don't need to take any other action. Without their knowledge, users are redirected to the cybercriminals' server, which we'll call the \"master server.\"\nStep 2: The master server injects an encrypted dynamic link library (DLL) file into the Java process (javaw.exe) on users' computers. The Java process runs in the machine's memory. The DLL takes advantage of a well-known vulnerability in Java (more on that in a bit).\nStep 3: The malware establishes communication between the user's computer and the master server. Included in the information sent to the master server are technical details about the infected machine. In this sense, the malware runs just like any other bot -- as a software robot that can execute automated tasks over the Internet. However, the AdFox bot is fileless and runs completely in memory.\nStep 4: The malware disables User Account Control (UAC), a Windows security component that's supposed to defend users' systems from hackers. The malicious software then seizes the permissions necessary to install a more robust type of malware. In the case of the Russian computers, that downloaded malware was the Lurk Trojan horse, an application whose main function is to steal sensitive data to gain access to online banking services.\nStep 5: The Lurk Trojan raids the cookie jar.\nAs noted above, the fileless malware exploits a known Java vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544). In Russia, cybercriminals exploited this vulnerability to attack Windows computers. However, Mac OS also supports Java, so Apple computers are potentially just as vulnerable. Fortunately, Oracle issued a patch in October 2011, so only computers that were not updated are susceptible.\nMore on malware and desktop security\nWindows 8 may be more secure, but don't ignore desktop vunerabilities\nProtecting endpoints with data loss prevention software\nSecurity expert praises Windows 8 memory defenses\nHow to thwart password attacks with user account security\nHowever, for those computers without the patch, the cybercriminals could easily load their bot into the trusted Java process. And the antivirus software, for the most part, had no idea it was there. In fact, the bot was essentially invisible.\nA world of fileless malware trouble\nAlthough attacks that took Russia by storm are relatively rare, similar ones have occurred in the past decade, most notably the Code Red and Slammer worms. Both of these worms took advantage of a vulnerability known as a buffer overflow, which also allows for a type of fileless attack similar to what we saw in Russia.\nGiven that these types of attacks have now occurred several times, there's no reason to assume that they won't happen again. And not necessarily just in Russia or against only Windows computers. And not necessarily limited to the Lurk Trojan. Other countries and operating systems are just as vulnerable, and other malware can spread just as easily.\nThe good news is that, because the fileless bot lives in memory, a simple system restart will get rid of the problem (if it's not already too late). As long as your users don't visit the same or other infected sites, they should have no further problems. And, of course, you should also ensure that the Java apps on their computers are up to date and that they have the latest security patches. This will at least protect them from the bot that hit Russia.\nBut as with any type of malware, the rules keep changing, and just because you can protect users from the latest fileless attack is no reason to assume that everyone is safe. What happened in Russia might not stay in Russia.\nIn addition, Apple recently announced that when it releases the next Mac OS update, Java will no longer be included with its browsers. Whether this has anything to do with the fileless bot is difficult to say. But Adam Gowdiak, a researcher at Polish firm Security Explorations, has reportedly identified two new security bugs in Java, so Apple is apparently playing it safe.\nThis was first published in December 2012", "label": 1}
{"text": "In general, you can't trust anything on an unsecured connection on any network where a MITM could be present (ie, you don't have complete physical control and security of the routing and wiring). A Man in the Middle could monitor and alter any unsecured connection by pretending to be you to the host and pretending to be the host to you. Neither system would be aware of the presence. The file could be entirely replaced or executable could be altered or replaced to do malicious things quite easily.\nThere are, however, a number of ways to prevent this. Authenticated connections such as HTTPS guarantee that only two end points (at least one of which is trusted) can communicate. In brief, HTTPS works by the server having a special piece of information that the browser can validate is the server you think it is. That information can then be used to send a key generated by your client to the trusted server in a way that only the server can understand. Because the MitM doesn't know the newly shared key, the server can then respond using that key to encrypt the connection and the MitM can no longer observe or alter the meaningful contents of that communication and any alterations would cause it to appear as gibberish (or possibly be detected based on the protocol in use).\nAnother technique is called checksums. A checksum is a small piece of information that can be independently provided to validate a much larger file. It generally consists of a hash of the file that is being sent which can then be rehashed after receipt in order to ensure the file didn't have any errors in transmission. If the checksum and the file are obtained from different connections, it is a little more difficult for the MitM to alter both, however it could still be possible for both to be altered. The checksum could also be cryptographically signed by the file distributor to ensure the checksum can not be altered by the MitM.\nThe best method is to combine the two approaches and include a cryptographically signed checksum that validates that the file came from the sender while also communicating the file over a secure connection. This ensures that the data isn't corrupted during transmission and also ensures that it comes from the expected host.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Introduction to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nWhat is Cross Site Request Forgery - CSRF\nWhen you take an action online - submitting a blog post, delete a photo, registering on a site, transferring money in a bank account - you are making a request to a site to perform that action for you. Several things happen automatically when you make a request to a site: lots of data is sent using either a \"POST\" or \"GET\" method of the HTTP protocol and your browser sends along any cookies you have for the site. The cookies contain your session identification for the site which is how the site knows who you are and what permissions you have.\nA CSRF occurs when a malicious user can trick you into making a specific kind of request to a site that you did not really intend to make AND when the site performs that action without confirming your intent. A simple example follows:\n- Your site has a list of accounts and presents links to delete accounts. That link points to a URL like http://example.com/admin/delete/user/2 which contains the account identifier for the account to be deleted (2 in this example)\n- A malicous attacker determines that you are an admin on the site and becomes your \"friend\" on a social networking site like twitter. They post a message to twitter @your_attention with a TinyURL that redirects to http://example.com/admin/delete/user/2\n- By the time you realize where the redirect is going, you've already deleted account #2. Depending on the system that may also delete all of the content associated with account #2.\nThe solution to this problem is a secret value associated with the action that is not easy to calculate called a token. When the form or link to take an action like deleting the account is sent to the browser the site sends along a string that includes something unique and only known by the site and the user. When the request is submitted the site validates that the token is still present and is appropriate for the action being taken. If it doesn't validate, the action is denied.\nVideo of CSRF in action\nThis video gives an example of CSRF. The problem is not in Drupal, but is in Tumblr. Tumblr does not confirm the intent of users using a CSRF token when a user deletes a submitted question.\nIn other operations on the site, Tumblr uses a session specific token that is the same during an entire session. This token is sent as a POST parameter and confirmed on the server side prior to accepting the operation.\nProtect Against Cross Site Request Forgeries in Drupal\nThe next step, of course, is to Protect your Drupal module against CSRF", "label": 1}
{"text": "Sandia tool puts disaster models into one picture\nThis season’s steady stream of natural disasters has underscored how important it is for first responders to plan and train for — and respond to — a variety of scenarios. But coordinating and sharing data can difficult because of the incompatibility of many modeling and simulation systems.\nNew software from an Energy Department lab could help solve the problem, allowing these different models to work together for the first time to create more realistic and precise models of disasters. And better models could improve coordination and response.\nThe Standard Unified Modeling, Mapping and Integration Toolkit (SUMMIT) was developed by the Sandia National Laboratories with funding from the Homeland Security Department's Science and Technology Directorate and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Exercise and Simulation Center.\nThe origins of the software came from the need to coordinate the multiple disaster planning, simulation and management programs that federal agencies had developed over the years, said Karim Mahrous, Sandia’s SUMMIT project lead. It became evident that there was a large gap in how disaster response exercises are currently planned and managed, he said.\nMultiagency exercises rely on scenario planning, which traditionally involves numerous experts meeting to discuss and plot out issues. Although this produces good results for a single event, Mahrous noted that the data is not reusable since the scenario and information used in one regional exercise cannot be moved to another.\nSUMMIT is designed to remedy this problem by quickly porting disaster data and information from one exercise into another.\nFor example, Mahrous said that the University of Arkansas created a model of a chemical plume from a derailed freight train for a local exercise. The model and data for the plume were then pulled and reused for another exercise in another state via SUMMIT, he said.\nFederal agencies such as FEMA and DHS have spent years designing models and simulations for disaster planning, but these various systems cannot work together or share information. SUMMIT is designed to knit together these different models to allow planners to quickly swap data and to set up new scenarios with existing information within minutes or even seconds.\n“SUMMIT’s entire role is to leverage that federal investment across the board,” Mahrous said.\nThe software for SUMMIT is platform-independent. It can run on desktop and laptop computers or on handheld devices such as smart phones, Andriod devices and iPads. In a recent earthquake response exercise, the organization managing the event wanted to create a tool that allowed organizations to modify the scenario to meet their objectives. The event planners then wanted to be able to move this planning data to first responders on the ground, which allowed them to see buildings damaged by the simulated earthquake. SUMMIT allowed this tool to be moved seamlessly to handheld devices. The porting to the iPad was just a convenience move for us, Mahrous explained.\nBefore SUMMIT, disaster response teams had to rely on written descriptions or other information to tell them about the extent of damage depicted in a scenario. This often led personnel on the ground to sometimes make up information because they had no immediate tools to model or assess a situation besides some maps and charts. For the first time they were able to see the post-disaster world that they were role-playing, Mahrous said.\nStitching together different models allows exercises to become more fine-grained and flexible. During FEMAs recent National Level Exercise 2011 (NLE-11), SUMMIT allowed organizers to model casualties created by different disaster types and their impact on hospital resources.\nHowever, another important potential application for SUMMIT is to allow these capabilities to be used to support first responders in a real event. Based on data from NLE-11, in a real situation such as a building collapse, FEMA could use the modeling tools connected by SUMMIT to quickly estimate casualties and contact local hospitals to alert them about incoming patients in real time, Mahrous said.\nBesides modeling disasters, FEMA's next initiative is to take a whole-community approach to better prepare citizens to respond to emergencies. Although Sandia is in the early stages of working out the approach with FEMA, Mahrous said that the goal is to create a publicly accessible website that would allow entire communities to crowdsource data during a disaster. SUMMIT would be vital in helping to structure and map the data posted on such a site.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Learn how to make a safe and secure password in including three parts!\nA strong, secure password is the most important thing that someone who surf the Internet and has accounts that hold important information can have. You want to make sure that your password is very unique and that it is something that no one would think about. Everyday there are many people who are victims of theft on the Internet. People will continuously try to guess the password to your bank account on-line. Eventually one of them may get in, that should only happen though if you have a poor password. So here are some tips that will help you create the absolute best password!\nPasswords should consist of at least 3 different parts. A word, symbol, and numbers.\nImage via Wikipedia\nPart One – Word(s)\nA word in your password will help you better remember the password itself. You are going to want to pick a word that doesn’t relate to you. Do not let it be your name, nick-name, favorites, hobbies, and other stuff like that. Pick something completely opposite you or even better, pick a random word out of the dictionary. Just make sure it is at-least 4 or 5 characters long, it can be longer but 4-5 is the smallest it should be. Once you find the right word, learn how to spell it backwards. This will just add a little more difficulty and complexity in your password.\nPart Two – Symbol(s)\nOnce you have selected an appropriate word your password you are going to want to add one or more symbols after it. You can choose any symbol from the top of your keyboard. If you choose to use the number symbol, “#”, make sure you use at least one more after or before that. I say this because if you are going to add numbers for the final part of your password, adding a number symbol may not be very effective.\nPart Three – Numbers\nAs you can see I said numberS. You have to make sure you have at least four numbers. Numbers are a key part of the password because there can be an unlimited amount of them. You are going to want to choose some numbers that also have no relation to you. Don not let it be your age, birth year, or any other date of any other family member. Try your best to just make it a few random numbers. If you want you can just close your eyes and clatter away at the number pad and see what you come out with!\nSo if you follow these three simple steps you should be able to make a very secure password that you can use to protect your most important accounts! Below is an example of a password I made to give you an idea. (It’s not one I use) As you can see I spelled the word “tree” backwards and I added a dollar symbol followed by a number symbol. Then I added 6 numeric characters.\nGood luck with your password!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cloud Control | Feature\nVirtualization and the Cloud: NOT the Same Thing\nThe terms cloud computing and virtualization are often--and mistakenly--used interchangeably. They are not the same. Indeed, comparing the cloud and virtualization is a bit like comparing an iPod to its earbud. While the earbud is a key component of the iPod, it is just one part of a bigger whole. The same goes for virtualization and the cloud.\nAnd just as an earbud can be used elsewhere, virtualization can happen without the cloud. Indeed, as many institutions can attest, virtualization often plays a vital role in university data centers, computer labs, and more--with no cloud in sight.\nSo what is virtualization exactly? Virtualization comes in many flavors: storage, desktop, memory, operating systems, servers. Put as simply as possible, virtualization allows you to do more with less. Most computers aren't used to their full capacity. Indeed, the average enterprise server runs at 5 to 10 percent of its capacity. Virtualization offers a way to consolidate the number of servers you operate by using just one machine to handle applications that had previously been handled by several physical servers.\nThis neat technological trick is performed with virtualization software, which was initially pioneered by IBM back in the 1960s. Today, it's one of the hottest IT fields on the planet, with players such as VMware, Citrix, Dell, Microsoft, and Oracle all duking it out for market share. Essentially, the software partitions a server into multiple virtual computers, each isolated from one another and with the capability to operate just like an actual server.\nIn a way, virtualization software acts like a mirrored fun house, tricking the system into believing there are more servers than there really are. But the benefits are very real. Virtual servers use less hardware, space, and power--and require less cooling--all of which reduces infrastructure and administrative costs. And when the need for more server space arises, users can carve a virtual server out of the existing hardware, rather than going out and buying another machine. What may have taken weeks to implement before can now be done in mere minutes.\nThe same principle underlies storage, desktop, memory, and operating system virtualization: The system fools the computer into handling multiple users' needs on one piece of hardware--a useful feature for universities that need to manage multiple machines from one location or provide identical services to multiple users.\nIt's safe to say that virtualization is already in place on the servers used by most public cloud providers, although the end user would never notice or see it. When it comes right down to it, the decision to virtualize an institution's servers or go to the cloud is not really a technological choice--it's a business decision.\nJennifer Skelly is a freelance journalist and screenwriter based in Los Angeles, CA.", "label": 1}

But false matches can lead to bad moves. In fact this is likely because the opposing side will tend to follow moves which are mis-judged, so avoiding collisions is important.\nOne way this is done is to use multiple \"independent\" hash functions. You only have to check the second if the first gives a match, so it isn't significantly slower than using a single hash function.\nAs the first poster suggests, this works.\nSurely this is a touch overblown\nI mean, for this kind of attack to be successful a malware author would need access to the source code of a safe application (to do the required additions to it) as well as this evil application.\nIf the bad guys have the ability to add code to your trusted apps then you're screwed anyway.\nEVERY hash function produces collisions\n\"SHA-1 is also known to produce collisions . . .\"\nSince the output of the hash function is a fixed number of bits, whilst the possible file inputs are nearly infinite, every hash function will produce collisions.\nThe weaknesses stem from tricks to FIND collisions. If I compute the hash for word.exe, AND I can produce a malware file then add some bytes so that it produces the same hash, I then have a file that can bypass hash-based whitelisting.\nHaving said that, I would agree with those above who suggest using 2 different hash functions on the same file. I'm not a cryptographer either, but I can't see why that wouldn't work.\nIn fact, I think this should be done anyway. Just because we think one method is secure now, there's nothing to say that it won't be circumvented tomorrow, either by ingenuity or increase in raw computing power. If a hash can be quickly calculated, do 3 different hashes anyway.\nIf PK encryption can be done with 1000-bit keys in a \"reasonable\" time now, then do so - never mind that we don't think even 128-bit keys can yet be easily broken. (Those are \"for example\" figures - I don't know how the state of the art is nowadays!). After all, how long will it be before botnets are decrypting confidential information between spam floods?\n128 bits is safe....\n>\"we don't think even 128-bit keys can yet be easily broken\"\nIt's not down to the number of bits. Brute force search of a 128 bit keyspace cannot be done, not now, not ever - the number is simply too big. This isn't a case of having a big enough bot net, it's a case of needing all the energy in a couple of suns to do it - not going to happen. Ever.\nNope... to break a code you need to find a flaw in the algorithm which makes brute force unnecessary. This is what happened to MD5.\nUsing two different checksum methods is probably a good idea.\nMD5 hash AND Cyclic Redundancy Check... is it too obvious???\nUsing multiple hash functions turns out not to improve things as much as one might expect. IIRC the paper showing this is by one Antoine Joux.\nFrom the get-go, Tripwire (you know, the filesystem integrity checker) was set up to use > 1 hash for this reason. IANAC either but would expect the probability of compromising 2 (or more) hashes to be extremely small -- at this point anyway. Ah, good ol' defense in depth...\n@Daniel du Preez\nWith a bit of tlc, you can add non-executing bytes to an executable without needing the source.\nThe idea as I understand it is that the malware author would write BOTH executables and have the clean sent to be whitelisted. Once it is then its hash will still match the malware code and the distribution can begin.\n\"whitelisted by submitting it to a classification server\"\nSorry, did I miss something? Either the \"classification server\" is run by someone *you* trust to show basic competence, or you are letting an untrusted agency run your whitelist and you are a cretin.\nre: Or Arbitrarily Slice\nProblem with dividing the file into 2 - it wouldn't take a lot of effort to make two sections with that match the two original file halves hashes and join them - after all the second half could just be junk just to get right hash (and pretty much all combinations of slicing and dicing I suspect with have same issues).\n> the possible file inputs are nearly infinite\n<chortle> Nearly infinite, hey? Well how big is that, since any quantity is by definition, er, infinitely smaller than infinite...\nDon't they hire real programmers?\nSo Symantec is looking for excuses of why its technology won't work. Don't they have smart people working for them? Maybe they should just close up shop.\nIt is funny how AV companies try to cover their #@$. Hash...hmmm...well I guess if every whitelisting company did it that way. Do any of you know how this whitelisting technolgy became popular? It all began about 7 years ago when a small company came to the Army Research Lab and then to the NSA SPOCK program. Everyone tried to figure out how this company did it...They tried using hash...Now everyone thinks that is how it is done. Why not find the company that started all this? www.seventhknight.com. They don't use hash and they surely are not going to tell you how they do it.\nOne thing I would like to remind everyone. Anything is better than AV technology. If it catches anything....guess what?....you are already infected....what a scam!!!!!!\nAV technolgy is a KNOWN failure.\n\"The idea as I understand it is that the malware author would write BOTH executables and have the clean sent to be whitelisted.\"\nWell, yes, that would work but why would you want to run even \"clean\" software from a dodgy vendor?\nThe point of whitelisting is that you or your IT department figure out the programs you need, find a reputable ISV and obtain the software from that ISV via a trusted path. Then everything else is sandboxed (or blocked). Where's the risk?\nWell your reputable ISV could have been taken over by malware types as you suggest. No new risk there, though. Given complete freedom to author software, I'm sure a competent programmer can insert malicious code that a whitelisting inspection fails to spot.\nAlternatively, the whitelisting might fail to reverse-engineer the entire app and prove that parameters to security-sensitive APIs can never take undesirable values. Actually that's inevitable and demonstrates why a \"whitelisting service\" is such a bad idea. It's likely that they'll just approve anything plausible from reputable ISVs. Rejection might lead to a lawsuit and they wouldn't want that! You, on the other hand, have no such fears, so you might actually be better able to whitelist than a commercial service.\nThe other approach\nWould an alternative not be to find some existing whitelisted app, and add appropiate extra bytes to some malware so that it matches? Wouldn't require access to anything but the malware.\nAC writes: \"Anything is better than AV technology. If it catches anything....guess what?....you are already infected....what a scam\"\nWhat are you smoking? AV tools prevent infection by detecting viruses (usually at time of download or time of reading/writing from/to disk). Typically, you only get infected when your AV software FAILS to detect the virus.\nAny AV software that detects a virus AND lets it infect your system is broken.\nBut what are the chance that you could successfully fake multiple different hashing algorithms at the same time?\nGentoo linux at least, maintains 4 different types of hash for each file it downloads.\n@Ken Hagan: @AC: @Daniel\nI think you're missing the point. It's not that the malware author would get you to run both executables. The author produces both files, and then submits the clean file to the AV companies for them to check and add to their whitelist. Then if you get the bad file on your machine your AV software won't pick it up since it will register it as being the good one.\nHere's a solution:\nSalt your hashes.\nIf each user prepended their own unique salt to an executable before hashing, a single maliciously crafted exe couldn't infect more than one person.\nI identified this sort of issue an while ago. Any simple hash function must produce the same value for countless combinations. Though most of those combinations might have limited/no practical use to an hacker, some intelligence can narrow down to an useful design.\nSo I devised an comprehensive idea (unimplemented) of multiple hash values that nullifies this potential threat. In reality, there maybe no file system supporting this level of comprehensiveness, so separate hash values would have to be maintained, and when an file change happens an comparison made (i.e. time consuming) until OS companies can incorporate such hash systems. Until then, the present hash systems can be incorporate with file change details, and file lengths. As an file change indicates something has happened (though the date might be got around, so OS companies will have to enforce, or at least enforce an flag that an change has happened). File length, because it is easy to make an hack that changes the file size without compromising file functionality, but hard to make one the same size, unless you refer to another file, in which case the files that the file passes execution to need to be pre-defined to easily detect unusual behaviour.\n@ Stephen B Streater\n\"One way this is done is to use multiple \"independent\" hash functions. You only have to check the second if the first gives a match, so it isn't significantly slower than using a single hash function.\"\nInitially this seems like a good idea, unfortunately the idea represents at least two fatally flawed assumptions.\n1) Significant time savings requires the file to not match the first hash result. This indicates the first hash function is sufficient. If the first is compromised then you have to run both to detect a bad match and you do have significantly slower verification. Since you expect files to verify most of the time, you are significantly slowing the verification process most of the time.\n2) Reading the file takes little time compared with calculating the result. Checking the access times for registers, cache, main memory and hard drives should show the flaw. If that is not enough then try this little experiment. Get a copy of md5sum, sha1sum, and whatever other hash functions you want. Create a simple program that reads a file 4KB at a time doing no processing on the data. Run these programs timing how long it takes to process the same really large file, try a DVD ISO or something. You will find it takes nearly the same amount of time to just read the file as it does to calculate the hash results.\nThe correct solution would be to always calculate two or more independent hash function results using a single program that only reads the file once. That way reading the file, the most time consuming part of the verification, only happens once. You get the benefit of multiple independent checks without significant increase in verification time.\nAV Technology....A known Failure\nWhen AV Technology detects a virus, unless detected in an email, you are already infected. It scans. Therefore, you can be infected until the scanner detects the virus. Have you ever noticed how a machine runs slow after being \"cleaned\". Have you ever had a virus that the scanner could not remove. AV technology is not proactive. It is reactive clean up. The damage is done. You could lose productivty, proprietary data, etc. Not to mention that is slows down your machine and constantly has to be updated. Oh, and where did all those updated come from. You guessed it, infected pcs. Now that is a joke.\n@ - AV Technology....A known Failure\nAV software is Reactive, you are right. As you can't predict an infection that's not been downloaded.\nJust like a Doctor can't treat an illness that you have never caught. Innoculations, sure. An innoculation works like a simple AV App's updates. Alert the system ( Your immune system / Anti-Virus application ) to a variation in the norm that's malicious, Antibodies ( Active/passive scanning of downloaded files ) are alerted in the system. Then the system ( Anti-Virus application / Immune System ) Jumps all over it once it penetrates the system and is detected ( Downloaded application / Caught an illness ). Only PC's are better since they scan EVERYTHING that comes in, a human's immune system is more of a dragnet.\nBut by the fact that you are downloading the file, the point of failure is the Luser, not the AV Application.\nIf you can create an Anti-Virus application that's Pro-active in it's workings, ( Heuristics? - HAHAHAHA *Thud* AAAHAHAHAHAHA! ) and comes up with less than say.. 2% ( Even this level is unaccepable in a medium sized organisation ) False-Posivive, and 0% False-Negative ( If you can't get this, then it's not Pro-Active, and things are defeating your hallowed app ) then by all means. Go for it.\nOtherwise, I'd suggest hitting the books and maybe Re-Education of yourself on a few matters.\nThe Damn Hash calc would use several hashing algorithms (plus variations) in a single file read.\nOf course you had to truse the author of the package in the first place\nIt's fairly easy in modern executables to hack a file without changing the file length, simply due to the number of 'caves' (caves being the term used by reverse engineers for blank space or redundant code). With current bloatware theres more than enough space to hide a whole operating system in there.\nWell, you're right, there can only be an infinite number of file inputs if infinite file length is possible which, of course, it isn't. The point is that the number of FEASIBLY possible file inputs might as well be infinite.\nIf, for example, you consider ONLY files of 4MB in size. There are 2^25 possible such files. A 128-bit hash has 2^7 possible values. Therefore, on average, each hash value can be derived from 2^18 different files.\nAs John Stag kindly pointed out, we can already provide security that is theoretically impossible to crack by brute-force methods. The problems arise when weaknesses in the security algorithms make it possible to bypass these theoretical limits and find a solution more directly.\nWinword.exe on my system is over 12MB in size. I'm pretty sure a decent (?) piece of malware could be written that would be a fraction of that size. If I then had some way to populate the other 11Mb with junk such that the MD5 (or whatever) hash of the whole file matched the original Winword.exe hash, it would pass a hash-based check.\nWithout actually being able to prove it, I am pretty well positive that there would be many different versions of my file that could be made to match the original MD5 hash. Whether it could AT THE SAME TIME match an SHA-1 hash, and/or an SHA-2 hash etc, would be a question for a REAL cryptographer!\nSurely there was never a better argument for open source than this\nI'm really not trying to start a flame war, but consider how hard it would be to infect an application that is recompiled on the target computer as part of the installation.\nSome form of compromise/infection surely can be done, but wouldn't it be harder to do, and much easier to fix if you could simply recompile?\nJust a note about key sizes (and heuristics)\nNot all crypto is equal: the \"safe\" key sizes for symmetric algorithms (AES et co) and asymmetric ie public-key (RSA et co) are vastly different simply because they're fundamentally different principles. Nevertheless the problem usually isn't the key space but some implementation/design mistake on a detail that allows the attacker to shortcut (or a major breakthrough in mathematics that allows \"easy\" solutions to problems previously thought to be \"hard\").\nAs for heuristics the engines have been pretty good for a long time and false positives can be managed with a signature list, nowadays with increasing computing power more thorough behaviour analysis is possible and at least F-Secure is doing reasonable job at it (http://www.heise-security.co.uk/news/100900)\nre: AV Technology....A known Failure\nEh? Maybe true(ish) for an active scanner that just looks for virus activity on a running PC but anyone who only uses that level of anti-malware protection on a Windows PC deserves viruses.\nMinimum basic precautions are..\nProperly configure (and use) your PC in as secure a manner as possible.\nScan all dangerous files at download time with a good, up-to-date virus scanner, preferably on a mail/proxy server and certainly before installing anything.\nRun an active scanner in case the other precautions failed.\nBack-up everything regularly in case you have to flatten your PC and start-over.\n\"If, for example, you consider ONLY files of 4MB in size. There are 2^25 possible such files. A 128-bit hash has 2^7 possible values. Therefore, on average, each hash value can be derived from 2^18 different files.\"\nReally? I don't think so. 2^7 possible values - that's only 128 values. A 128 bit hash has 2^128 possible values. That's over 3.4 X 10^38. As the sun has a mass of approx 1.9 X 10^30. That's 17 million times the mass of the sun in kilos. Or, in file sizes, a single file of 3.4 X 10^14 terrabytes. One file of this size would be needed to generate all the possible combinations.\nThat's (for current computers) not a space that can brute-forced.\nThere are 10 types of people in this world:\nThose who understand binary,\nThose who don't and\nThose who start counting at 0\n- Geek's Guide to Britain INSIDE GCHQ: Welcome to Cheltenham's cottage industry\n- 'Catastrophic failure' of 3D-printed gun in Oz Police test\n- Game Theory Is the next-gen console war already One?\n- BBC suspends CTO after it wastes £100m on doomed IT system\n- Peak Facebook: British users lose their Liking for Zuck's ad empire", "label": 1}
{"text": "(ARA) - By now, most parents are aware that the entertainment and educational value of the Internet also comes with risks, particularly for children. Protecting children from those risks is a vital concern for any parent whose child uses the web and any web-enabled device.\nOnline child safety measures should encompass steps that protect children from a variety of threats - including damage to a child's reputation, contact from predators, spamming, bullying, and risks of identity theft. Here are some common online risks and what parents should know about how to protect their children:\nAs soon as children become active online they need to understand that what they say and share on the Internet \"lives forever.\" With a growing number of employers, colleges and universities including social media outlets in the background check process, teenagers' online activity could potentially impact their ability to be admitted into their college of choice and even their later job prospects.\nProtecting a child's online reputation can be a complex task. Consider parental help sites like SafetyWeb.com. The online tool provides targeted monitoring and customizable utilities to help parents track their children's presence in cyber space. The tool filters mobile phone and Internet activity for both positive and risky behavior, provides parents with timely alerts, and allows parents to see accounts, photos, friends, tweets, posts, texts and calls through one convenient online dashboard.\nThe FBI notes that online predators often target children. Some invest a great deal of time, effort and even money into winning a child's trust, while others engage in immediate inappropriate behaviors and conversations with children. To minimize the risk of children falling victim to sexual predators, the FBI advises parents to make sure their children know to never:\n* Arrange a face-to-face meeting with someone they met online.\n* Share pictures of themselves with people they don't personally know.\n* Provide identifying information like their name, address, school name or phone numbers.\n* Download pictures from someone they don't know.\n* Respond to inappropriate online communication.\n* Believe that everything they're told online is true.\nAs soon as children learn they can communicate with others via email, they'll want their own email accounts. As soon as they have an email account, they can become victims of spamming, junk mail, hijacking and malware. To minimize the risks of your child's email being abused, take these precautions:\n* Teach children to not open emails, links, posts or online advertisements from someone they don't know.\n* Teach children to be wary of emails with attachments, even if they come from an email address they think they recognize.\n* Show kids how to create and use strong passwords.\n* Make sure your antivirus and security software is always up to date and active on computers and other mobile devices.\nCyberbullying is an assault on a child's online reputation and self-esteem, often by other children. The National Crime Prevention Association (NCPA) defines it as the use of the Internet, cell phones or other electronic devices to \"send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person.\" The organization says cyberbullying affects as many as half of all American teens.\nNCPA says children can help prevent cyberbullying by refusing to participate in it, speaking out against it when they see it occurring, blocking communication with cyberbullies, and reporting instances to adults they trust. Parents can also help by:\n* Developing rules for their children about cyberbullying and making sure the kids understand the rules.\n* Raising awareness of the issue within the community.\n* Sharing anti-cyberbullying messages and measures with friends.\nA 2009-2012 Carnegie Melon CyLab study of more than 42,000 children younger than 18 found that more than 10 percent had someone else using their Social Security numbers. The youngest victim was just 5 months old.\nTo reduce the risk of children falling victim to identity thieves, parents should protect minors' Social Security numbers. Never carry your child's Social Security card, and if a company, school or medical provider requests it, ask why it's needed and if you can provide some alternate form of identification. Teach children the importance of this valuable number and to never share it unless truly called for.", "label": 1}

{"text": "2,295: The number of times a sequential list of numbers was used, with “123456″ by far being the most popular password. There were several other instances where the numbers were reversed, or a few letters were added in a token effort to mix things up.\n160: The number of times “111111″ is used as a password, which is only marginally better than a sequential list of numbers. The similarly creative “000000″ is used 71 times.\nProtect your information by creating a secure password that makes sense to you, but not to others.\nMost people don’t realize there are a number of common techniques used to crack passwords and plenty more ways we make our accounts vulnerable due to simple and widely used passwords.\nCommon Ways Hacks Happen\nDictionary attacks: Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations— such as qwerty or asdfg. Don’t use dictionary words, slang terms, common misspellings, or words spelled backward. These cracks rely on software that automatically plugs common words into password fields. Password cracking becomes almost effortless with a tool like John the Ripper or similar programs.\nCracking security questions: Many people use first names as passwords, usually the names of spouses, kids, other relatives, or pets, all of which can be deduced with a little research. When you click the “forgot password” link within a webmail service or other site, you’re asked to answer a question or series of questions. The answers can often be found on your social media profile. This is how Sarah Palin’s Yahoo account was hacked.\nSimple passwords: Don’t use personal information such as your name, age, birth date, child’s name, pet’s name, or favorite color/song, etc. When 32 million passwords were exposed in a breach last year, almost 1% of victims were using “123456.” The next most popular password was “12345.” Other common choices are “111111,” “princess,” “qwerty,” and “abc123.”\nReuse of passwords across multiple sites: Reusing passwords for email, banking, and social media accounts can lead to identity theft. Two recent breaches revealed a password reuse rate of 31% among victims.\nSocial engineering: Social engineering is an elaborate type of lying. An alternative to traditional hacking, it is the act of manipulating others into performing certain actions or divulging confidential information.\nTips to Make Your Passwords Secure\n- Make sure you use different passwords for each of your accounts.\n- Be sure no one watches when you enter your password.\n- Always log off if you leave your device and anyone is around—it only takes a moment for someone to steal or change the password.\n- Use comprehensive security software and keep it up to date to avoid keyloggers (keystroke loggers) and other malware.\n- Avoid entering passwords on computers you don’t control (like computers at an Internet café or library)—they may have malware that steals your passwords.\n- Avoid entering passwords when using unsecured Wi-Fi connections (like at the airport or coffee shop)—hackers can intercept your passwords and data over this unsecured connection.\n- Don’t tell anyone your password. Your trusted friend now might not be your friend in the future. Keep your passwords safe by keeping them to yourself.\n- Depending on the sensitivity of the information being protected, you should change your passwords periodically, and avoid reusing a password for at least one year.\n- Do use at least eight characters of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. Remember, the more the merrier.\n- Strong passwords are easy to remember but hard to guess. Iam:)2b29! — This has 10 characters and says “I am happy to be 29!” I wish.\n- Use the keyboard as a palette to create shapes. %tgbHU8*- Follow that on the keyboard. It’s a V. The letter V starting with any of the top keys. To change these periodically, you can slide them across the keyboard. Use W if you are feeling all crazy\n- Have fun with known short codes or sentences or phrases. 2B-or-Not_2b? —This one says “To be or not to be?”\n- It’s okay to write down your passwords, just keep them away from your computer and mixed in with other numbers and letters so it’s not apparent that it’s a password.\n- You can also write a “tip sheet” which will give you a clue to remember your password, but doesn’t actually contain your password on it. For example, in the example above, your “tip sheet” might read “To be, or not to be?”\n- Check your password strength. If the site you are signing up for offers a password strength analyzer, pay attention to it and heed its advice.\nIn the end, it’s the responsibility to the public to protect themselves. This disclosure now requires those currently exposed to change their password. The rule of thumb is to change your passwords frequently, every six months. It’s a cliché, but true, passwords need to be strong. Let the keyboard be your palate and be creative. A common mistake people make is that they use dictionary or slang terms. Beware. Dictionary attacks use software that automatically plugs common words into password fields making password cracking effortless for various tools.", "label": 1}
{"text": "By Geeta Dayal... via Wired.com\nDon’t you dare even think about your banking account password when you slap on those fancy new brainwave headsets.\nOr at least that seems to be the lesson of a new study which found that sensitive personal information, such as PIN numbers and credit card data, can be gleaned from the brainwave data of users wearing popular consumer-grade EEG headsets.\nA team of security researchers from Oxford, UC Berkeley, and the University of Geneva say that they were able to deduce digits of PIN numbers, birth months, areas of residence and other personal information by presenting 30 headset-wearing subjects with images of ATM machines, debit cards, maps, people, and random numbers in a series of experiments. The paper, titled “On the Feasibility of Side-Channel Attacks with Brain Computer Interfaces,” represents the first major attempt to uncover potential security risks in the use of the headsets.\n“The correct answer was found by the first guess in 20% of the cases for the experiment with the PIN, the debit cards, people, and the ATM machine,” write the researchers. “The location was exactly guessed for 30% of users, month of birth for almost 60% and the bank based on the ATM machines for almost 30%.”\nTo detect the first digit of the PIN, researchers presented the subjects with numbers from 0 to 9, flashing on the screen in random order, one by one. Each number was repeated 16 times, over a total duration of 90 seconds. The subjects’ brainwaves were monitored for telltale peaks that would rat them out.\nThe EEG headsets, made by companies such as Emotiv Systems and NeuroSky, have become increasingly popular for gaming and other applications. For the study, the researchers used the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset, which retails for $299.\nThe researchers — Ivan Martinovic of Oxford University; Doug Davies, Mario Frank, Daniele Perito, and Dawn Song of UC Berkeley; and Tomas Ros of the University of Geneva — analyzed P300 peaks, an important component of event-related potentials — electrical potentials that happen after the user is presented with a stimulus.\nThe P300 “occurs approximately 300 milliseconds after an event happens,” said Frank, a postdoctoral researcher at Berkeley, in a phone interview with Wired. “The potential arises if you already prime your thoughts toward a particular event…. An attacker could try to prime the thoughts of the victim towards a particular secret that a victim has in mind. For instance, if you know the face of some person, you might be able to observe a brainwave pattern that is evidence of the user thinking about the face.”", "label": 1}

{"text": "Recently, a non-programmer friend pointed out that there is no simple explanation of capabilities available on the web. Less than a week later, another friend -- this one a senior operating system developer for a major UNIX software company -- said to me that he really didn't understand what I was working on (capabilities). If neither the lay reader nor the experts understand what these things are, an introductory description is definitely needed, so I set out to write one. I quickly discovered that doing so isn't easy. Capabilities themselves are very simple, but they turn everything people ``know'' about security upside down. A lot of people look at them and say ``this is too simple to possibly work.''\nThis essay is a basic introduction to capabilities and capability-based systems. Rather than try to give an exhaustive discussion, I have taken some editorial liberties in the interest of clarity:\nThis essay will tell you what the term access control covers, what a capability is, and provide some examples of how capabilities can be used to provide flexible access to objects without giving up security. I'll describe some problems that currently popular access control mechanisms cannot handle. I'll talk about the problem of revoking access, and how this is solved. Finally, I'll give my own opinion on how capabilities came to be rejected by mainstream computing people.\nWhile this essay uses UNIX as its example system, the problems identified with UNIX exist in VMS, Windows/NT and Windows95 as well.\nIf you find this note helpful, or you have suggestions for improvement, please drop me some mail at email@example.com.\nThe basic problem of computer security is to control which objects a given program can access, and in what ways. Objects are things like files, sound cards, other programs, the network, your modem, and so forth. Access means what kind of operations can be done on these objects. Examples include reading a file, writing to a file, creating or deleting objects, communicating with another program, etc.\nWhen we talk about ``controlling access,'' we are really talking about four kinds of things:\nPreventing access: You want to make sure that one person cannot damage another, or peek at another person's private information. I should not be able to read your medical records, for example. You should not be able to delete my work. This is the what most people mean when they talk about computer security.\nLimiting access. You want to ensure that a program or a user doesn't do more than you mean them to. For example, you might want to run a program off of the Web but prevent the program from reading or writing any files so that it cannot plant a computer virus or give away your private phone book. This issue has been getting more attention lately with all of the hype around Java.\nGranting access. You may want to allow two people to work together on a document or to grant access to a particular file to someone else so that you can delegate a job to them. Note however, that you probably want to do this selectively. Just because we are working on a business plan together doesn't mean that I should get to read your medical records. From a practical perspective, this is just as important as the first two, but security people don't tend to think about it very much.\nRevoking access. Having allowed access to an object, you may later need to take that access back when the person is no longer authorized to look at a particular document.\nAccess control is about determining what a program can access, not about what a person can access. In computers, people do not access objects; programs do. This distinction has practical importance for several reasons:\nHaving set the stage, we can now turn to what capabilities are, and how access control is accomplished using them.\nThe term capability was introduced by Dennis and Van Horn in 1966 in a paper entitled Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations. The basic idea is this: suppose we design a computer system so that in order to access an object, a program must have a special token. This token designates an object and gives the program the authority to perform a specific set of actions (such as reading or writing) on that object. Such a token is known as a capability.\nA capability is a lot like the keys on your key ring. As an example, consider your car key. It works on a specific car (it designates a particular object), and anyone holding the key can perform certain actions (locking or unlocking the car, starting the car, opening the glove compartment). You can hand your car key to me, after which I can open, lock, or start the car, but only on your car. Holding your car key won't let me test drive my neighbor's Lamborghini (which is just as well -- I would undoubtedly wrap it around a tree somewhere). Note that the car key doesn't know that it's me starting the car; it's sufficient that I possess the key. In the same way, capabilities do not care who uses them.\nCar keys sometimes come in several variations. Two common ones are the valet key (starts, locks, and unlocks the car, but not the glove compartment) or the door key (locks/unlocks the car, but won't start it). In exactly this way, two capabilities can designate the same object (such as the car) but authorize different sets of actions. One program might hold a read-only capability to a file while another holds a read-write capability to the same file.\nAs with keys, you can give me a capability to a box full of other capabilities.\nCapabilities can be delegated. If you give your car key to me, you are trusting me not to hand it to somebody else. If you don't want trust me, you shouldn't hand me the key.\nCapabilities can be copied. If you give me your car key, there is nothing to stop me from going down to my local car dealer and having a duplicate key made. In practice, this isn't much of a problem, because you wouldn't have handed me the key if you didn't trust me. If it comes down to desperate measures, you can change the locks on the car, making all of the keys useless. This can be done with capabilities too; it is known as severing an object, which has the effect of rescinding all capabilities. A rescinded capability conveys no authority to do anything at all.\nIn fact, there are only a few ways that capabilities and ordinary keys are different. The important differences are:\nKey Points: Capabilities are simple and familiar. You use them every day, and they don't surprise you very often. If you think about ordinary keys and the sorts of access controls they provide you will not go far wrong.\nIn order to be useful, capabilities must be unforgeable. If you could just conjure up a key to any car you wanted, they wouldn't provide much protection. Protecting capabilities from forgery can be handled in either hardware or in system software. The software approach is more convenient because it can run on an ordinary PC. EROS, which is currently the fastest capability system in existence, does this in system software, and the data suggests that there wouldn't be any real benefit to doing it in hardware.\nIn a capability-based computer system, all access to objects is done through capabilities, and capabilities provide the only means of accessing objects. In such a system, every program holds a set of capabilities. If program A holds a capability to talk to program B, then the two programs can grant capabilities to each other. In most capability systems, a program can hold an infinite number of capabilities. Such systems have tended to be slow. A better design allows each program to hold a fixed (and small -- like 16 or 32) number of capabilities, and provides a means for storing additional capabilities if they are needed. The only way to obtain capabilities is to have them granted to you as a result of some communication.\nHolding a large number of capabilities is usually foolish. The goal is to make the set of capabilities held by each program as specific and as small as possible, because a program cannot abuse authority it does not have. This is known as the principle of least privilege.\nIn this kind of system, a program that wants to perform an\noperation on an object must hold a capability to that\nobject. To perform the action, it invokes the\ncapability and names the action that is to be\nperformed. In the UNIX® operating system, for\nexample, the system call\nThe main problem with capabilities is finding a way to save them to disk so that you can get them back. This is one of the main reasons that few capability systems have been built, and the main reason why most current capability systems break down at the file system boundary.\nAssume for a minute that your program had a capability that let it create a file and write things down in it. Suppose it does so, and all of the information you need has now been written down. My helpful dog, Sheena, now comes along and kicks your computer's plug out of the wall. We start the system up and we now have to answer a chicken and egg problem:\nThese problems basically stumped capability system designers until the early 1970's.\nThe usual solution has been to have some kind of file\nsystem, grant every program the right to use the\nfile system, and use some sort of user-identity based\nsystem to decide which programs can open which files. If a\nprogram is running on behalf of Natasha (my other dog), it\ncan open any of the files that Natasha created. Such a\nsystem is called an access control list (ACL)\nsystem. Every object has attached to it a list of users\nand the actions that each user is authorized to\nperform. If the user is on the access control list, then\nprograms operating on behalf of that user can obtain a\ncapability for that object. Once they have the capability,\nthey can manipulate the object itself. This is the purpose\nof the UNIX\nTake a minute to go back and look at the four things an access control mechanism was supposed to accomplish. ACL systems can prevent and revoke access, but they can neither limit access nor grant access. All programs running on behalf of Natasha -- even that raging inferno program written by a stranger in Norway -- can get access to any of Natasha's objects. In current ACL systems, there is no means to subset these rights. Also, there is no way for Natasha to delegate some of her authority (say, access to a single file she does not own) to me unless Natasha owns the object(s) in question. Unless she owns the object, she cannot modify the access control list.\nA better solution is not to have a common file system, and not to give any program access to the file system by default. File systems are very useful, but most programs and subsystems do not need access to them. A spell checker that runs as part of a word processor, for example, needs access to the particular files it works on, but has no need to open any other files (and therefore no need of access to a file system).\nIf things aren't remembered by writing them in a file, some other means must be found to remember them. The solution is to simply remember everything. Every five minutes, write down all of the things the computer is working on. If Sheena pulls the plug, the system simply comes back to the last saved copy. Since the saved copy includes all of the running programs, there is no need to figure out who is entitled to what when the system restarts.\nYou might think this is an inefficient approach. In practice it's actually faster than file systems and requires less code.\nOf course, the user may have walked away from the machine, so a means is needed to get back to their work. The solution is to give every user a program that runs on their behalf (the window system, if you like) at all times. The job of the login agent is to reconnect you to your window system, where all of your programs are still running.\nTraditional access control systems run into trouble with a variety of important problems. Here are some examples of these problems in today's computer systems, and an explanation of why the problems do not exist in capability systems.\nConsider the program that changes your password. It needs\nthe authority to read and write the password file, but\nmust not give that authority to you. In an ACL system the\nonly way to do this is to have access to the password file\nrestricted to a special user (\nBoth of these mechanisms are insecure. Giving the password program all of root's authority is simply too much. In the VMS mechanism, the program file itself can be attacked, leaving a hard to find security hole. The next time the program is run it will obey the new program, which can do absolutely anything.\nMaybe more important, such programs tend to get into trouble over time. As maintainers alter these programs without fully understanding their constraints, they become sources of new security flaws.\nThe right solution is to explicitly give the program access to the password file, and not leave the password program lying around in a file system where it can be overwritten. In a capability system, you simply give the program a capability to the password database and let it run forever. You then give out a capability that lets people run the password program but does not let them read or modify that program.\nSuppose you have a program that manages your financial data. You don't really want it sending that information to the IRS without your permission, but your computer is attached to the network. In an ACL system, since you have access to the network, so does the program. In a capability system you simply leave the capabilities for the network out when you install the program, guaranteeing that it cannot send data to those helpful, friendly people at the IRS.\nJava solves this problem by ad-hoc restrictions. You may have noticed that people keep finding new security problems with Java. This is because ad-hoc security mechanisms don't work. It is better to have done the job right in the first place. Capabilities have a formal, mathematically sound model that can be (and has been) used to prove their security.\nThe really hard part, however, is dealing with collaboration. Suppose I have a secret program that is very valuable. I'm afraid to give out the binary code, because somebody will decompile it and steal my program (yes, this really does happen). You have some very secret data concerning the results of a new drug trial. You need to run my program, but you're not willing to show me the data.\nIn a capability system, we can set things up so that you can run the program without being able to see the code, but you are able to control what authority my program is given. Since you control the authorities, you can ensure that my program will not tell me your secrets. Since you cannot gain access to the binary code, you cannot steal the program. Most computer security experts believe that this is impossible. In ACL systems, it really is impossible.\nOne problem with capabilities is that there is no way to say \"Remove all of Fred's access to this object.\" If Sheena (my dog) decides to leave me for another owner, how do I take away her capability for the dog food can? More realistically, if your employee leaves how do you make sure that their access to the file cabinet is cut. More importantly, suppose the user isn't fired, but is just moved to another department, and should no longer have access to sensitive documents in their old department?\nOn the face of it, there seem to be three different cases here:\nActually, the last two cases are the same.\nIn both capability and ACL systems, the first problem is solved by deleting the user's login.\nIn both capability and ACL systems, the second problem can be solved by creating a new login for the same user and selectively copying into the new account those personal documents that the user should retain access to. In many cases this is the best solution. In capability systems, another solution is possible: build a software-enforced special compartment that prevents the documents from being copied out of the compartment, and only let the user access those documents inside the compartment. This is not the same as a user group. In the user group approach, the user may have made copies of the documents. Deleting them from the group will prevent future damage, but does nothing to control theft while the user has legitimate access.\nRevoking access to a particular object is exactly like the special compartment problem. Either you build a special compartment in advance, or there really isn't any good way to prevent the user from absconding with the data.\nSo if capabilities are so much better than ACLs, why haven't they been used? How come so many companies are shipping insecure operating systems when we know how to solve these problems?\nPart of the problem is historical. The early capability systems were built in hardware before we knew a lot about hardware architecture, and used capabilities for access to main memory. This made them terribly slow and terribly complex. Those systems are a good bit less complex than today's operating systems, but their reputation persists.\nIn the 1970s, an operating system called MULTICS came along, and most of the world went galloping down the UNIX trail. UNIX is an extraordinary system, designed in a day when most computers were not connected to the outside world. In a world where all of the other users are known to you, collaboration is more important than security. The UNIX security mechanisms are adequate for a collaborative environment. Until the advent of the Internet and commonplace connectivity, only a few machines running dedicated financial applications needed to worry seriously about security, and those machines needed to implement it in the application anyway.\nIn the 1980s a lot of truly mediocre work was done on microkernels (which are similar to modern capability systems), and some equally bad analysis concluded that the problem was with microkernels in general rather than with the flaws of particular implementations. We now have examples of microkernels that are significantly faster than conventional operating systems, and at least one example of a capability system that is so.\nThe bottom line is that over the past 25 years a huge investment has been put into insecure systems, and until there is a compelling reason to change these systems the people who support them won't bother. In fact, computer software vendors have taken steps to ensure that they are not held liable for the flaws in their software, even when they are real, demonstrable, and incontrovertable. Until this changes, there is no reason to do secure systems. One of the arguments that has been made against capability systems is that capabilities and access control lists can be made formally equivalent (if you make enough repairs to access control lists, that is). This is a deceptive argument, because people think that means they are the same. Two things can be theoretically the same without being practically the same. I can imagine ways to augment traditional access control lists to handle suspicious collaborators on paper, but the solutions are both unacceptably draconian and too slow to actually use.\nThings are changing slowly. Java is a partial step in the right direction, and the PR around Java is starting to wake users up to how exposed they are. Over time you can expect to see some of the Java ideas embedded in mainstream systems.\nActually, compatibility environments for UNIX have been built that run securely on top of capability systems (it's worth noting that you can't build a capability system on top of an ACL system), so it may not be necessary to discard existing code.\nHopefully, you now know what a capability is, and can start to take part in discussions about them. At some point soon I'll add links here to other sources of information for people who want to read further.\nCopyright 1999 by Jonathan Shapiro. All rights reserved.

{"text": "Within the last years, the increasing presence of large-scale architectures has introduced the era of Cloud Computing.\nThere is a huge number of different definitions available towards Cloud Computing. The term \"cloud\" itself is derived from the figurative abstraction of the internet represented as a cloud. The available definitions of Cloud Computing range from reductions it to be ``the next hype term\" over pragmatic definitions focusing on special aspects to definitions, that see Cloud Computing as a general paradigm shift of information architectures, as an ACM CTO Roundtable [Cre09] has shown in 2009. Of the various features that are attributed to the \"cloud\", scalability, a pay-per-use utility model and virtualization are the minimum common denominators.\nThe key concept of Cloud Computing is the resourcing of services. These services can be generally differentiated into three vertical layers:\nReferring to the terminology of Cloud Computing, a scalable web application is essentially a SaaS that requires appropriate execution/hosting environments (PaaS and/or IaaS).\nIn the following, we will consider some exemplary hosting providers and outline their service features.\nAmazon was one of the first providers for dedicated, on-demand and pay-per-use web services. It is currently dominating the multi-tenant Cloud Computing market. Their main product is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a service providing different virtualized private servers. The provision of virtualized machines in scalable amounts forms an architectural basis for most of their clients. Instead of growing and maintaining own infrastructure, EC2 clients can spin up new machine instances within seconds and thus cope with varying demand. This traditional IaaS hosting is complemented by a set of other scalable services that represent typical architecture components.\nElastic Block Storage (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. Simple Storage Service (S3) is a key-value web-based storage for files. More sophisticated data storage systems available are SimpleDB, DynamoDB and Relational Database Service (RDS). The former two services represent non-relational database management systems with a limited set of features. RDS currently supports MySQL-based and Oracle-based relational databases.\nElastic Load Balancing (ELB) provides load-balancing functionalities on transport protocol level (e.g. TCP) and application level (e.g. HTTP). As a message queue, Simple Queue Service (SQS) can be used. For complex MapReduce-based computations, Amazon has introduced Elastic MapReduce.\nElastiCache is an in-memory cache system that helps speeding up web applications. CloudFront is a CDN, complementing S3 by replicating items geographically. For monitoring purposes, Amazon has come up with CloudWatch, a central real-time monitoring web service.\nBesides these services, Amazon has introduced their own PaaS stack, called Elastic Beanstalk. It is essentially a bundle of existing services such as EC2, S3 and ELB and allows to deploy and scale Java-based web applications. Furthermore, there are additional services that cover business services such as accounting or billing.\nThe Google App Engine is a PaaS environment for web applications. It currently provides support for Python, Go and several JVM-based languages such as Java. Applications are hosted and executed in data centers managed by Google. One of its main features is the automatic scaling of the application. The deployment of the application is transparent for the user, and applications encountering high load will be automatically deployed to additional machines.\nGoogle provides free usage quotas for the App Engine, limiting traffic, bandwidth, number of internal service calls and storage size among others. After exceeding these limits, users can decide to add billable resources and are thus getting charged for additional capacities.\nThe runtime environment of the application is sandboxed and several language features are restricted. For instance, JVM-based applications cannot spawn new threads, use socket connections and access the local file system. Furthermore, the execution of a request must not exceed a 30 seconds limit. This restrictions are enforced by modified JVMs and altered class libraries.\nBesides an application container, the App Engine provides several services and components as part of the platform. They are accessible through a set of APIs. We will now have a brief look at the current Java API.\nThe Datastore API is the basic storage backend of the App Engine. It is schemaless object datastore, with support for querying and atomic transaction execution. Developers can access the datastore using Java Data Objects, Java Persistence API interfaces or via a special low-level API. A dedicated API provides support for asynchronous access to the datastore. For larger objects, and especially binary resources, the App Engine provides a Blobstore API. For caching purposes, the Memcache API can be used. Either using a low-level API or the JCache interface.\nThe Capabilities API enables programmatical access to scheduled service downtimes and can be used to develop applications that prepare for the unavailablity of capabilities automatically. The Multitenancy API provides support for multiple separated instances of an application running in the App Engine.\nImages can be manipulated using the dedicated Images API. The Mail API allows the application to send and receive emails. Similarly, the XMPP API allows message exchange based on XMPP. The Channel API can be used to establish high-level channels with clients over HTTP and then push messages to them.\nThe Remote API opens an App Engine application for programmable access using an external Java application. Other web resources can be accessed using the URLFetch API.\nThanks to the Task Queue API, there is some support for tasks decoupled from request handling. Requests can add tasks to a queue, and workers asynchronously execute the background work. The Users API provides several means to authenticate users, including Google Accounts and OpenID identifiers.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Virtual Private Networking\nIf you've understood most of this document so far, the principles of Virtual private networking (VPN) will be easy to understand. The most confusing part of VPN is that many acronyms show up. This is partly because VPN requires data encryption to be \"private\" and there are many encryption techniques and terms. Also there are many complicated security issues relating to VPN concerning encryption and user authentication. This section will first explain the concept and methodology behind VPN, then explain some of the acronyms. I can't explain them all, there will be more tomorrow.\nPurpose of VPN\nThe function of VPN is to allow two computers or networks to talk to each other over a transport media that is not secure. To do this VPN uses a computer at each of the two or more points on the various ends of the transport media such as the internet. Each point at the end of the transport media (internet) is called a point of presence (POP). In this example, the transport media is the internet. In the example below our company \"Boats and More, Inc.\" has four offices. One in Boston, St Petersburg, Seattle, and San Diego. The owner wants a networking setup so he can access any of the 4 network locations at any time through the internet. He wants his data secure since some of it is confidential. His offices are set up on networks 10.1.x.x, 10.2.x.x, 10.3.x.x, and 10.4.x.x. Each of the four networks, when they need to send a data packet to one of the other networks, will route its data packet to its respective router, A, B, C, or D. For example if a computer on the 10.1.x.x network in Boston needs to send a packet to a computer with address 10.3.6.1 on the network in San Diego at 10.3.x.x, it will send its packet to its router, A. Since the network number, 10.x.x.x, is reserved for private use, the packet can't be sent going from computer A with 10.3.6.1 as its intended address. This is because the routers on the internet will not recognize this address as a valid destination. IP masquerading won't solve this problem since the computer on the other end would have no way of knowing that a packet that it didn't send was a masqueraded packet. Tunneling is the technique used to solve this problem.\nTunneling means that the complete IP packet to be sent from Boston to San Diego must be encapsulated into another IP packet. This new packet will have a legal internet IP address. Therefore, machine A will take the packet it needs to route (already has destination address 10.3.6.1) and roughly the following will happen:\n- Machine A will extract the IP packet.\n- Machine A will encrypt the packet.\n- Machine A will wrap the original IP packet in a new IP packet with destination address 126.96.36.199, which is machine C's true internet address.\n- Machine A will wrap the new IP packet in an ethernet packet and send it to the network.\n- The packet will be routed through the internet until it reaches machine C.\n- Machine C will extract the outer IP packet.\n- Machine C will determine that the IP packet contains another IP packet and extract it.\n- Machine C will decrypt the packet.\n- Machine C will examine the destination address of the inner IP packet, wrap it in an ethernet packet with the correct ethernet address, and send it to the internal network on its port 10.3.1.1.\nThis description is simplistic, but it is essentially what happens. This did not account for authentication and being sure machine C had the authority or ability to decrypt the packet. Therefore VPN can be examined in two main functional areas which are the tunneling mechanism and the security mechanisms.\nVPN tunneling Protocols\nThe list below describes the tunneling protocols which may be used for VPN.\n- L2F - Layer2 Forwarding, works at the link layer of the OSI model. It has no encryption. Being replaced by L2TP.\n- PPTP - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (RFC 2637) works at the link layer. No encryption or key management included in specifications.\n- L2TP - Layer2 Tunneling Protocol. (RFC 2661) Combines features of L2F and PPTP and works at the link layer. No encryption or key management included in specifications.\n- IPSec - Internet protocol security, developed by IETF, implemented at layer 3. it is a collection of security measures that address data privacy, integrity, authentication, and key management, in addition to tunneling. Does not cover key management.\n- Socks - handled at the application layer\nIn addition ot tunneling, VPN needs to provide for authentification, confidentiality, data integrity and key management. This is important if you need to keep your data going across the transmission media, secret. The capability of sending the data is easy, but the security measures necessary make VPN a much more complex subject. Security functions that must be covered are:\n- Authentification - Making sure the data is from where it is supposed to be from.\n- Confidentiality - Keeping any third parties from reading or understanding the data.\n- Data integrity - Being sure the data received was not changed by a third party and that it is correct.\n- Access control - Keeping third parties without authorization from getting access to your data or network.\nEssentially the part of the system that must make the data secure, must encrypt the data and provide a method to decrypt the data. There are many different encryption formulas, but typically handling of decryption is usually done by providing a \"key\" to the party that must decrypt the data. Keys are secrets shared between two parties, that allow one party to pass encrypted information from one to the other without third parties being able to read it. It is similar to a house or car key that allows only members of your family to enter the house or use the car. Keys are a digital code that will allow the second party to decrypt the data. The digital code must be long enough to keep any third parties from being able to break the code by guessing. Key management can be a complex subject since there are many ways to implement it, but it needs to be secure so no third party gets, intercepts, or guesses the key.\nThere are many different protocols used to support each of the above functions. Each have various advantages and disadvantages including the fact that some are more secure than others. If you are going to use VPN as a data exchange method, and you want secure data, you or someone on your staff had better know what they're doing (Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the protocols and how to implement them properly), or sooner or later, you may get burned.\nManaging user access rights and Key Management or Authentification Systems\nTwo key management protocols are:\n- RADIUS - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service is used for dial in clients to connect to other computers or a network. It provides authentication and accounting when using PPTP or L2TP tunneling.\n- ISAKMP/Oakley - Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol Authentication uses one of the following three attributes to authenticate users.\nMore than one means of authentification is recommended for stronger security.\n- Something you have such as a key.\n- Something you know such as a secret.\n- Something you are such as your fingerprint.\n- PPTP - Point to point tunneling protocol (RFC 2637)\n- L2TP - Layer 2 tunneling protocol (RFC 2661)\n- IPIP tunneling - Tunneling IP packets in IP packets.\nEncryption protocols, methods and terms:\n- CIPE - Crypto IP Encapsulation\n- SSL - Secure sockets layer\n- IPSEC - Internet protocol security\n- PAP - Password Authentification Protocol is a two way handshake protocol designed for use with PPP.\n- CHAP - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol is a three way handshake protocol which is considered more secure than PAP.\n- TACACS - Offers authentication, accounting, and authorization.\n- S/Key - A one time password system, secure against replays. RFC 2289.\nProjects and software:\n- SWAN - Secure wide area network\n- PoPToP Point to point tunneling protocol server.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Crime and Control\nThe Future of Computer Crime\nThe previous chapter discussed computer crime but its subject was metaphor. This time it is crime.\nTHE PAST AS PROLOGUE\nIn the early years, computers were large stand-alone machines; most belonged to governments, large firms, or universities. Frequently they were used by those organizations to control important real-world actions – writing checks, keeping track of orders, delivering goods. The obvious tactic for computer criminals was to get access to those machines and change the information they contained – creating fictitious orders and using them to have real goods delivered, arranging to have checks written in payment for nonexistent services,1 or, if the computer was used by a bank, transferring money from other people’s accounts to their own.\nAs time passed, it became increasingly common for large machines to be accessible from offsite over telephone lines. That was an improvement from the standpoint of the criminal. Instead of having to gain admission to a computer facility – with the risk of being caught – he could access the machine from a distance, evading computer defenses rather than locked doors.\nWhile accessing computers to steal money or stuff was the most obvious form of computer crime, there were other possibilities. One was vandalism. A discontented employee or ex-employee could crash the firm’s computer or erase its data. But this was a less serious problem with computers than with other sorts of machines. If a vandal smashes your truck, you have to buy another truck. If he crashes your computer, all you have to do is reboot. Even if he wipes your hard drive you can still restore from your most recent backup, losing only the most recent data.\nA more interesting possibility was extortion. In one British case, a supervisor of computer operations for a large multinational firm decided that it was time to retire. He took the reels of tape that were the mass storage for the firm’s computer, the backup tapes, and the extra set of backups that were stored offsite, erased the information actually in the computer, and departed. He then offered to sell the tapes – containing information that the firm needed for its ordinary functioning – back to the firm for a mere £275,000 (about $700,000).2\nIn a world with\nanonymous ecash, the payoff could have been made and the\ndelivered over the net via a remailer. In a world of strong\nhe could have located a criminal firm in the business of\npayoffs and subcontracted the collection end of his project.\nUnfortunately for the executive, he committed his crime too\ntried to collect the payoff himself – on a motorcycle – and\ncaught doing it.\nLarge computers controlling lots of valuable stuff still exist, but nowadays they are usually connected to networks. So are hundreds of millions of small computers. This opens up some interesting possibilities.\nA few years back, the Chaos Computer Club of Hamburg, Germany, demonstrated one of them on German television. What they had written was an ActiveX control, a chunk of code downloaded from a web site onto the user’s computer. It was designed to work with Quicken, a widely used accounting package. One of the things Quicken can do is pay bills online. The control they demonstrated modified Quicken’s files to add one additional payee. Trick a million people into downloading it, have each of them pay you ten marks a month – a small enough sum so that it might take a long time to be noticed – and retire.\nOne of the classic computer crime stories – possibly apocryphal – concerns a programmer who computerized a bank’s accounting system. After a few months, bank officials noticed that something seemed to be wrong – a slow leakage of money. But when they checked the individual accounts, everything balanced. Eventually someone figured out the trick. The programmer had designed the system so that all rounding errors went to him. If you were supposed to receive $13.436 in interest, you got $13.43, his account got .6 cents. It was a modest fraud – six-tenths of a cent is not much money, and nobody normally worries about rounding errors anyway. But if the bank has a million accounts and calculates interest daily, the total comes to about $5,000 a day.\nThat sort of fraud is called a “salami scheme” – nobody notices one more thin slice missing from a salami.3 The Chaos Computer Club had invented a mass production version. Hardly anyone notices a leakage of a few dollars a month from his account but, with millions of accounts, it adds up fast. It is the old computer crime of tricking a computer into transferring money to you modernized for a world with lots of networked computers that each control only small amounts. So far as I know, nobody has yet put this particular form of computer crime into practice, despite the public demonstration that it could be done. But someone will.\nA modern criminal who preferred extortion to theft could hold the contents of computers for ransom using either a downloaded ActiveX control or a computer virus – and take advantage of the power of public key encryption. Once the software gets onto the victim’s computer it creates a large random number and uses it as the key to encrypt the contents of the hard drive, erasing the unencrypted version as it does so. The final step is to encrypt the key using the criminal’s public key and erase the original.\nThe next time the computer is turned on, its screen shows a message offering to unencrypt the contents of the hard drive for twenty dollars in anonymous ecash, sent to the criminal through a suitable remailer. The money must be accompanied by the encrypted key, which the message includes. The extortionist will send back the decrypted key and the software to decrypt the hard drive.\nFrom the standpoint of the criminal, the scheme has two attractive features. The first is that since each victim’s hard drive is encrypted with a different key, there is no way one victim can share the information about how to decrypt it with another – each must pay separately. The second is that, with lots of victims, the criminal can establish a reputation for honest dealing; after the first few cases, everyone will know that if you pay you really do get your hard drive back. So far as I know, nobody has done it yet, although there was an old case involving a less sophisticated version of the scheme, using floppy disks instead of downloads.\nWhat else can be done in a world of lots of small networked computers? One answer is vandalism, familiar in the form of computer viruses. A more productive possibility is to imitate some of the earliest computer criminals and steal, not money, but computing power. At any instant, millions of desktop computers are twiddling their thumbs while their owners are eating lunch or thinking about what to type next. When you operate at millions of instructions a second, there’s a lot of time between keystrokes.\nThe best-known attempt to harness that wasted power is SETI – the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. It is a volunteer effort by which large numbers of individuals permit their computers, whenever they happen to be idle, to work on a small part of the immense project of searching the haystack of interstellar radio noise for the needle of information that might tell us that, somewhere in the galaxy, someone else is home. Similar efforts on a smaller scale have been used in experiments to test how hard it is to break various forms of encryption, another project that requires very large-scale number crunching.\nOne could imagine an enterprising thief stealing a chunk of that processing power – perhaps justifying the crime on the grounds that nobody was using it anyway. The approach would be along SETI’s lines, but without SETI’s public presence. Download a suitable bit of software to each of several million unknowing helpers, then use the internet to share the burden of very large computing projects among them. Charge customers for access to the worlds’ biggest computer while keeping its exact nature a trade secret. Think of Randy Schwartz – who, whether or not he stole trade secrets, had the reputation of grabbing all the CPU power he could get his hands on. Nobody has done it. My guess is that nobody will, since the continuing access is too easy to detect. But two more destructive versions have been implemented repeatedly.\nOne is called a Distributed Denial of Service attack – DDOS, for short. To do it, you temporarily take over a large number of networked computers and instruct each to spend all of its time trying to access a web page belonging to some person or organization you disapprove of. A web server can send out copies of its web page to a lot of browsers at once, but not an unlimited number. With enough requests coming fast enough, the server is unable to handle them all and the page vanishes from the web.\nA second reason to temporarily take over lots of computers that don’t belong to you is to solve the spam problem – not the problem that you and I face in dealing with in-boxes clogged by hundreds of offers to expand various parts of our anatomy but the problem faced by the people sending spam. If you send it from your own computer, you might get into trouble – if not with the recipients, then with your own ISP. One solution is to use a computer virus to modify lots of other people’s computers in a way that gives you temporary access to them and then use them as your unwitting accessories.4\nSpam itself provides multiple examples of computer crimes made possible by the existence of enormous numbers of networked computers. Nobody with any sense would believe an email from a stranger in Nigeria offering to give him millions of dollars – after he first provides some small financial evidence of his reliability. But if you send out such an offer to a billion email addresses, ten million of which turn out to be actual people, you will reach the small minority of those ten million who are sufficiently credulous, or sufficiently greedy, to fall for the scam. A small minority of ten million people can still be a large number.\nDISTRIBUTED COMPUTING: THE SOLUTION THE PROBLEM COMES FROM\nMost of the problems we have been discussing involve software downloaded from a web page to a user’s computer. Such software originated as a solution to one of the problems of networked computing: server overload.\nYou have a web page that does something for the people who access it – draws a map showing them how to get to a particular address, say. Drawing that picture – getting from information on a database to a map a human being can read – takes computing power. Even if it does not take very much power, when 1,000 people each want a different map drawn at the same time it adds up and your system slows down.\nEach of those people is accessing your page from his own computer. Reading a web page does not take much in the way of computing resources, so most of those computers are twiddling their thumbs – operating at far below capacity. Why not put them to work drawing maps?\nThe web page copies to each of the computers a little map-drawing program – an ActiveX control or Java applet. That only has to be done once. Thereafter, when the computer reads the web page, the page sends it the necessary information and it draws the map itself. Instead of putting the whole job on one busy computer it is divided up among 1,000 idle computers. The same approach – distributed computing – works for multiplayer webbed games and many other applications. It is a solution – but a solution that, as we have just seen, raises a new problem. Once that little program gets on your computer, who knows what it might do there?\nMicrosoft deals with that problem by using digital signatures authenticated by Microsoft to identify where each ActiveX control comes from. Microsoft’s response to the Chaos Computer Club’s demonstration of a new use for an ActiveX control was that there was really no problem. All a user had to do to protect himself was to tell his browser, by an appropriate setting of the security level on Explorer, not to take controls from strangers.\nThis assumes that nobody can fool Microsoft into signing bogus code. I can think of at least two ways of doing it. One is to get a job with a respectable software company and insert extra code into one of their ActiveX controls, which Microsoft would then sign. The other is to start your own software company, produce useful software that makes use of an ActiveX control, add an additional unmarked feature inspired by the Chaos Computer Club, get it signed by Microsoft, put it up on the web, then close up shop and decamp for Brazil.\nSun Computer has a different solution to the same problem. Java applets, their version of software for distributed computing, are only allowed to play in the sandbox, designed to have a very limited ability to affect other things in the computer, including files stored on the hard drive. One problem with that solution is that it limits the useful things an applet can do. Another is that even Sun sometimes makes mistakes. The fence around the sandbox may not be entirely applet-proof.\nThe odds are\nboth ActiveX and applets will soon be history. Whatever form\ndistributed computing succeeds them will face the same problem\nthe same set of possible solutions. In order to be useful, it\nbe able to do things on the client computer. The more it can\ngreater the danger of its doing things that the owner of that\ncomputer would disapprove of. That can be controlled either by\ncontrolling what gets downloaded and holding the firm that\nit responsible for the software’s behavior or by strictly\nwhat any such software is allowed to do – Microsoft’s and\nReaders with high-speed internet connections may at this point be wondering if they ought to pull the plug. I don’t think so – and I haven’t.\nThere are two important things to remember about the sort of problem we have been discussing. The first is that it is your computer, sitting on your desktop. A bad guy may be able to get control of it by some clever trick, by getting you to download bogus software or a virus. But you start with control – and whatever the bad guy does, you can always turn the machine off, boot from a CD, wipe the hard drive, restore from your backup, and start over. The logic of the situation favors you. It is only bad software design and careless use that makes it possible for other people to take over your machine.\nremember is that this is a new world and we have just arrived.\ndesktop computers are running under software originally\nstand-alone machines. It is not surprising that such software\nfrequently proves vulnerable to threats that did not exist in\nenvironment it was designed for. As software evolves in a\nworld, a lot of the current problems will gradually vanish.\nUntil the next innovation.\nTHE WORM TURNS: CLIENTS FOOLING SERVERS\nWe have been discussing crimes committed by a server against clients – downloading chunks of code to them that do things their owners would not approve of. I once got into an interesting conversation with someone who had precisely the opposite problem. He was in the computer gaming business – online role-playing games in which large numbers of characters, each controlled by a different player, interact in a common universe, allying, fighting each other, gaining experience, becoming more powerful, acquiring enchanted swords, books of spells, and the like.\nPeople running online games want lots of players. As more and more players join, the burden on the server supporting the game increases, since it has to keep track of the characteristics and activities of an increasing number of characters. Ideally, a single computer should keep track of everything in order to maintain a consistent universe, but there is a limit to what one computer can do.\nOne solution is distributed computing. Offload most of the work to the player’s computer. Let it draw the pretty pictures on the screen, maps of a dungeon or a fighter’s eye view of the monster he is fighting. Let it keep track of how much gold the character has, how much experience he has accumulated, what magic devices are in his pouch, what armor on his back. The server still needs to keep track of the shared fundamentals – who is where – but not the details. Now the game scales; when you double the number of players you almost double the computing power available, since the new players’ computers are now sharing the load.\nLike many solutions, this one comes with a problem. If my computer is keeping track of how strong my character is and what goodies he has, that information is stored in files on my hard drive. My hard drive is under my control. With a little specialized knowledge about how the information is stored – provided, perhaps, by a fellow enthusiast online – I can modify those files. Why spend hundreds of hours fighting monsters in order to become a hero with muscles of steel, lightening reactions, and a magic sword, when I can get the same result by suitably editing the file describing my character? In the online gaming world, where many players are technically sophisticated, competitive, and unscrupulous – or, if you prefer, where many players regard competitive cheating as merely another dimension of the game – it is apparently a real problem. I offered him a solution; I do not know if he, or anyone else, has tried implementing it.\nThe server cannot be bothered to keep track of all the details of all the characters, but it can probably manage 1 in 100. Pick a character at random and, while his computer is calculating what is happening to him, run a parallel calculation on the server. Follow him for a few days, checking to make sure that his characteristics remain what they should be. If they do, switch to someone else.\nWhat if the character has mysteriously jumped twenty levels since the last time he logged off? Criminal law solves the problem of deterring offenses that are hard to detect – littering, for example – by scaling up the punishment to balance the low probability of imposing it. It should work here too.\nI log into the game where my character, thanks to hundreds of hours of playing assisted by some careful hacking of the files that describe him, is now a level 83 mage with a spectacular collection of wands and magic rings. There is a surprise waiting:\n\"You wake up in the desert, wearing only a loin cloth. Clutched in your hand is a crumpled parchment.”\n\"Look at the Parchment.”\n\"It looks like your handwriting, but unsteady and trailing off into gibberish at the end.”\n\"Read the Parchment.”\nThe parchment reads:\n\"I shouldn’t have done it. Dabbling in forbidden arts. The Demons are coming. I can feel myself pouring away. No, No, No … .”\n\"Show my statistics.”\nPossessions: 1 loincloth.\n5HIGH-TECH TERRORISM: NIGHTMARE OR EMPLOYMENT PROJECT?\nA few years ago, I participated in a conference called to advise a presidential panel investigating the threat of high-tech terrorism. So far as I could tell, the panel originated with an exercise by the National Security Agency in which they demonstrated that, had they been bad guys, they could have done a great deal of damage by breaking into computers controlling banks, hospitals, and much else.\nI left the conference uncertain whether what I had just seen was a real threat or an NSA employment project, designed to make sure that the end of the Cold War did not result in serious budget cuts. Undoubtedly a group of highly sophisticated terrorists could do a lot of damage by breaking into computers. But then, a group of sophisticated terrorists could do a lot of damage in low-tech ways too. I had seen no evidence that the same team could not have done as much damage – or more – without ever touching a computer. A few years after that conference, a group of not very sophisticated terrorists demonstrated just how much damage they could do by flying airplanes into buildings. No computers required.\nI did, however, come up with one positive contribution to the conference. If you really believe that foreign terrorists breaking into computers in order to commit massive sabotage is a problem, the solution is to give the people who own computers adequate incentives to protect them, to set up their software in ways that make it hard to break in. One way of doing so would be to decriminalize ordinary intrusions. If the owner of a computer cannot call the cops when he finds that some talented teenager has been rifling through his files, he has an incentive to make it harder to do so in order to protect himself. Once the computers of America are safe against Kevin Mitnick,6 Osama bin Laden won’t have a chance.\n1 A timeline of hacker history and an account of a legal setback for the Secret Service.

{"text": "Top 10 tips for staying safe online\nWhile the ever-evolving conveniences of online shopping and digital communication often make life a little easier, sharing valuable information over the Internet comes with a considerable amount of risk. Consumers should not only be aware of the dangers of being online, but should also take preventative measures to avoid becoming a victim of online scams or fraud.\n“Protecting valuable information online is just as important as securing a home, car or personal possessions,” says Rebecca Smith, vice president of marketing for Master Lock. “It is essential that people educate themselves and take the proper precautions to safeguard their information online, ensuring important account data and passwords are protected within the digital space.”\n1. Firewalls are your friend: Be sure to activate your computer’s firewalls as they are great tools to provide you with a line of defense against hackers and Internet crime. Firewalls monitor all the communication occurring between your computer, a network (say at the office) and the Internet and can prevent strangers from accessing your information.\n2. Surf and shop safely: Consumers should be careful when surfing or shopping on a site they’ve never visited before. Good indicators that a site is secure include checkout pages with lock symbols or sites with the prefix \"https,\" indicating that a page is encrypted or scrambled.\n3. Download security software: There is a wide variety of security software available that automatically updates itself and can protect your personal computers from viruses, spyware and other online threats that are constantly in play. Sign on and scan your computer for viruses and other malware once a week to ensure your information stays safe.\n4. Create strong passwords: Short, easy-to-remember passwords, are typically not complex enough to prevent being hacked. When creating passwords for online bank accounts and other sites, use passwords with at least 10 characters that are a combination of letters, numbers and most importantly, symbols. It’s also a good idea to change your passwords on a monthly basis to keep it secure.\n5. Be cautious: Avoid posting any personal information online, do not open email messages from strange addresses and never give your browser permission to remember your passwords.\n6. Shut it down: We all know that with many advances in technology, one can be connected at all times. However, being online 24/7 comes with risks. Attackers and/or viruses are more likely to target your computer if you are always connected.\n7. Back it up: Consider backing up all of your most important information at least twice a month and rest easy knowing it is stored safely in more than one place.\n8. Use parental controls: Many Internet browsers offer the option to set parental controls. Check out your options to restrict the websites viewed on your computer and protect the settings you select with a password your kids won’t be able to figure out. This way, you’re keeping your information, and more importantly, your children safe from various online dangers.\n9. Lock up your valuable info: Consider utilizing a secure, online storage application or website, such as the free Master Lock Vault, to house all of your passwords, account numbers and essential information and documents under one easily accessible, yet completely secure location. Storing this information online is safer than keeping hard copies or a non-protected file on your computer. Services like the Vault can act as an encrypted digital safe deposit box and give users peace of mind that their vital information is locked up tight.\n10. Two is better than one: User authentication, also known as two-tier or device authentication, should always be enabled if offered by sites that collect your secure or private data at registration. With this enabled, you may receive an email or text message with a verification code to complete your account set-up. While this may seem inconvenient at the time of sign-up, the extra protection is well worth this extra step.\nFor more advice on online safety and security, visit www.masterlock.com or www.masterlockvault.com.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Does the name Bradley Manning mean anything to you? If you’re a government organization, the name is synonymous with “colossal data breach” – as Manning spearheaded the biggest leak of classified information in our nation’s history.\nTo briefly recap, Manning, a U.S. Army soldier, single handedly accessed more than 900,000 intelligence documents, including daily war logs from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he did it by downloading files onto CDs labeled “Lady Gaga”, which he shared with the whistleblower site, WikiLeaks.\nAccording to Manning’s published chat logs, the event was “childishly easy”; “no one expected a thing”; and the “weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, and inattentive signal analysis created a perfect storm.”\nWith Manning’s trial just a few months away, we take a look back to share three important lessons learned from this monumental event:\nLesson #1: DLP is Important: While Manning had access to a classified network used by the Department of Defense and the State Department, having a data loss prevention (DLP) solution in place that scanned information, across all network points before it left the network, would have provided an additional line of defense to prevent the data from being downloaded – to a CD, flash drive, or any other storage mechanism.\nLesson #2: It’s Time to Cast a Wider Security Net: Because most government agencies are large, data security can be focused on the “core” or interior of the network versus the perimeter of the organization. But, big data security challenges arise as employees have new ways to view and share confidential data – via BYOD movements, wireless access points, and consumer-based, third-party file sharing sites. Now that networks have become more decentralized, agencies need to deploy a wider “net” to secure and manage data.\nLesson #3: Security and Large File Size Aren’t Mutually Exclusive: Large data transfers are not only common within the government domain, they are often required. But how are agencies securing and managing that data? And, can large files be shared simply and on demand? To address these needs, organizations are turning to mobile file sharing solutions that give employees the ability to send and synchronize large, classified and confidential documents with ease, while giving IT the security, authentication, encryption and file tracking and reporting capabilities necessary to support data security best practices.\nThese are three key lessons to remember as we move into 2013 and strive to keep newsworthy security breaches a part of our past, fully protecting government data exchanges of the future.", "label": 1}

{"text": "First, when you're talking about encrypting passwords, then sending them to the server, that implies to me that you are storing the password in plain text, which is a very bad idea (if you are encrypting them in the database, it is slightly better, but still not ideal, since the key would still be stored on the server somewhere in plain text).\nNo, you're quite incorrect. PHP's encryption function resides on the server itself. He's not storing the passwords as unencrypted text, however, he is sending it unencrypted via the wire (from the browser to the server). His best bet is to get SSL encryption on the domain itself (https://) so everytime he logs in, the request (and corresponding response) is hashed using the latest algorithms.\nI think there is a bit of confusion with our definitions. When I'm saying encryption, I'm meaning applying a key to some plain text to encrypt it, so that it can be decrypted at a later date (such as AES, RSA, HTTPS, etc). By hashing, I mean applying an algorithm on some plain text to encrypt it, so that it cannot be decrypted later, by anyone (such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc; not HTTPS).\nHe was talking about two different things: encryption between the client and the server and encrypting/hashing the passwords in the database. You're correct that the PHP/MySQL functions will handle the encryption/hashing of the passwords in the database, but they will do nothing for encrypting the communication between the client and the server (he'll need HTTPS).\nSecond, PHP code is not executed on the client's machine, so even if you did encrypt the password with PHP, it would still be sent to you in plain text, which is bad.\nThis is vague. When the client causes a POST in a form, the password is sent to the server unhashed. All HTTP traffic is insecure, if you want to secure traffic then use HTTPS (but you need to purchase an SSL license). This way, even if the user enters his password, the browser encrypts the request and sends it to the server encrypted.\nThat's correct (he could use a self-signed certificate for free, but that is not as secure as one from a certificate authority - i.e. if you can afford one, buy it).\nThat's one way of doing it. Sending it via an HTTPS session secures the unencrypted password over the wire by encrypted the request in itself.\nOn further thought, I don't think the first hash is necessary (the one done on the client's machine), because if they can get that hash, they can get access to the account, and if they have your password, they can determine the hash.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Implantable Medical Devices with Wireless Pose Threats\nSome medical devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers are now equipped with wireless technology, allowing for remote device checks and freeing patients from repeated doctor visits. But this convenience may come with unanticipated risks. A team of researchers from three leading universities has demonstrated that patients’ private medical information could be extracted and their devices reprogrammed without the patients’ authorization or knowledge.\nThere has never been a reported case of a patient with an implantable cardiac defibrillator or pacemaker being targeted by hackers, and the researchers emphasized that the study was designed to identify and prevent future problems. Undertaking the study required a high level of technical expertise, and the published paper omits certain details in methodology that prevents the findings from being used for anything other than improving patient security and privacy.\nThe study was led by two computer scientists, Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington and Kevin E. Fu of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and cardiologist Dr. William H. Maisel of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. Their scholarly peer-reviewed report will be presented and published at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Symposium on Security and Privacy in Oakland, Calif., May 19, 2008.\nDr. Maisel, director of the Medical Device Safety Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, notes, “One of the purposes of this research is to encourage the medical device industry to think more carefully about the security and privacy of patient information, particularly as wireless communication becomes more common. Fortunately, there are some safeguards already in place, but device manufacturers can do better.”\nThe team expects this issue to take on greater importance as implantable cardiac defibrillators operate wirelessly at greater distances. These devices typically receive short-range wireless signals over several feet, but new technologies are expanding that reach even farther, creating the potential for information to be intercepted en route.\n“We hope our research is a wake-up call for the industry,” said Kohno, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. “In the 1970s, the Bionic Woman was a dream, but modern technology is making it a reality. People will have sophisticated computers with wireless capabilities in their bodies. Our goal is to make sure those devices are secure, private, safe and effective.”\nFu, an assistant professor of computer science at UMass Amherst, noted that the study developed several prototype defenses. “One of our primary contributions is the invention of three defense mechanisms that require no battery power, making them potentially easy to incorporate in the devices without extensive redesigning. While there has been much research that explores the biological safety of implantable medical devices, there is limited understanding about the related issues of wireless security and privacy. Understanding the security and privacy of implantable devices is essential for protecting the nation’s health and cyber infrastructure.”\nThe researchers’ experiments used an implantable cardiac defibrillator, a sophisticated device that automatically regulates the heart beat by sending small electrical signals to the heart to stimulate the heart rate or by delivering a large shock to restore a potentially fatal heart rhythm back to normal. Implantable defibrillators have improved survival in selected patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, and millions of the devices have been implanted worldwide. The model used in the researchers’ experiment contained computers and radios that allow health-care practitioners to diagnose patients, read and write private medical information, and adjust the device’s therapy settings wirelessly.\nIn computer laboratory bench tests, the research team used an inexpensive software radio to intercept and capture signals sent from the implantable device. They were able to obtain detailed information about a hypothetical patient, including name, diagnosis, date of birth and medical ID number. Researchers could determine the make and model of the device and access real-time electrocardiogram results as well as data on the hypothetical patient’s heart rate and cardiac activity.\nThe team then mounted several attacks. Researchers were able to turn off the therapy settings stored in the implantable device, rendering it incapable of responding to dangerous cardiac events. Additional commands were delivered, resulting in the delivery of a shock that could induce ventricular fibrillation, a potentially lethal arrhythmia.\nThree deterrence and prevention mechanisms were developed as part of the study, including a notification device that audibly alerts patients of security sensitive events, a device that authenticates requests for access from outside devices and a vibrating device that patients can sense. All three mechanisms require no power from the battery, and one of them was evaluated for effectiveness in a substance similar to human tissue.\nBecause the team studied one common model of implantable cardiac defibrillator, the susceptibility of similar devices to privacy and security risks is uncertain. The researchers believe future studies are needed to assess potential risks associated with other implantable devices equipped with wireless technology. The researchers feel strongly that nothing in their report should deter patients from receiving these devices if recommended by their physician. The implantable cardiac defibrillator is a proven, life-saving technology.\nPhoto Caption: Professors Kevin Fu (UMass, third from left) and Tadayoshi Kohno (UW, far right), with Ph.D. students (from left to right) Daniel Halperin (UW), Benjamin Ransford (UMass), Benessa Defend (UMass), and Shane Clark (UMass).

{"text": "First mobile phone virus identified\nA Series 60 mobile phone displays the Cabir virus message. Photo: http://symantec.com\nThe first ever computer virus that can infect mobile phones has been discovered, according to anti-virus software developers.\nThe French unit of the Russian security software developer Kaspersky Labs said that that virus - called Cabir - appears to have been developed by an international group of hackers called 29A, who specialise in creating \"proof of concept\" viruses which try to show that no technology is reliable and safe from their attacks.\n29A is the hexadecimal (a number system used in computing) equivalent of \"666\", otherwise known as the devil's number.\nCabir infects the Symbian operating system that is used in several makes of mobiles, notably the Nokia brand, specifically the Nokia Series 60 mobile.\nIt propagates through the new bluetooth wireless technology that is in several new mobile phones, scanning for other phones using Bluetooth wireless technology, then sends a copy of itself to the first vulnerable one it finds.\nOnce the worm is running, it will constantly search for Bluetooth-enabled devices, vastly shortened battery life because of the constant scanning.\nIf the virus succeeds in penetrating the phone, it writes the inscription 'Caribe' on the screen and is then activated every time that the phone is turned on.\n29A sent the code to anti-virus software developers on Tuesday, who have since verified in lab test that it can be spread from phone to phone.\nAs the virus has only been circulated in a controlled laboratory setting, it poses no risk to the wider public. There are no known cases of it \"in the wild\".\n29A is credited with the release of a recent virus called \"Rugrat\" that targets Windows 64 bit operating systems.\nIn May, researchers from the Symantec anti-virus software group identified W634.Rugrat.3344 and linked it to a family of six viruses that are all believed to be the work of the same author or group of authors. Each of the viruses demonstrates a different \"first ever\" infection technique.\nAccording to the anti-virus software developer F-Secure, the discovery of Cabir is proof that the technologies are now available to create viruses for mobile phones and that they are now known to the writers of computer viruses.\nAnti-virus experts have been warning for months that mobile phone viruses are set to multiply, given the increasingly diverse uses of mobile phones.\nIn 2000, the virus Timifonica forced infected PCs to send text messages to phones, but the Cabir virus is thought to be the first to spread from phone to phone.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Windows NT has always had a rich access control model\nto protect sensitive system resources from modification by or\ndisclosure to unauthorized entities. Within this model, user accounts\nare typically given Administrator rights or User rights. Administrators\nhave complete and unrestricted\naccess to the computer and all its resources, while Users are\nrestricted from making changes to operating system configuration or\naccessing data belonging to other users. For historical reasons,\nhowever, until recently end users on Windows computers were frequently\ngranted administrative access, so many people have remained unaware that\nthese distinctions exist. (Even today, the first local user account\ncreated on a Windows 7 computer is a member of the Administrators\nUsers can have effective\nadministrative control over a computer without explicit membership in\nthe Administrators group if they are given the ability to configure or\ncontrol software that runs in a more powerful security context—for\nexample: granting users control over systemwide file or registry\nlocations used by administrators or services (as Power Users had before\nWindows Vista); granting users “admin-equivalent” privileges such as the\nDebug, Take-Ownership, Restore, or Load Driver privileges; or enabling\nthe AlwaysInstallElevated Windows Installer policy, under which any MSI\nfile launched by any user runs under the System account.\nwishing to improve security and reduce costs have begun moving toward a\n“non-admin” model for their end users. And with Windows Vista’s\nintroduction of User Account Control (UAC), most programs run by\nusers—including those who are members of the Administrators\ngroup—execute with user rights, not administrative rights. However, it\nsometimes becomes necessary to run a program with administrative rights.\nWhile many people didn’t know how to do this in Windows XP, Windows\nVista changed those methods significantly.\nMany of the\nSysinternals utilities always require administrative rights, while many\nhave full functionality without them. Some, however, are able to work\ncorrectly with standard user rights but have features that need\nadministrative rights, and thus operate in a “partially degraded” mode\nwhen executed with standard user rights.\n1. Running a Program with Administrative Rights on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003\nIf you log on to a Windows XP or\nWindows Server 2003 computer with an account that is a member of the\nAdministrators group, no special steps are required to run a\nSysinternals utility with administrative rights. Every program you run has full administrative rights.\nBut if you log on to that\nsame computer with an account that does not have the required\nprivileges to run a particular Sysinternals utility, you will need to\nget the administrative rights from a different user account. The\nSecondary Logon (Seclogon) service enables programs to start a new\nprocess as a different user on the current desktop by supplying\nalternative credentials. Two programs that expose this functionality are\nExplorer’s Run As dialog box and the Runas.exe command-line utility.\nuse the Run As dialog box to start a program with administrative\nrights, right-click on any program or shortcut in Explorer or the Start\nmenu and choose Run As from the context menu. In the Run As dialog box,\nchoose the second radio button (“The Following User) as shown in Figure 1,\ntype the credentials for an administrative account, and click OK. You\ncan make Run As the default for a shortcut by opening its Properties\ndialog box, clicking the Advanced button, and selecting the “Run With\nDifferent Credentials check box.\nFigure 1. The Windows XP Run As dialog box with the second radio button selected.\nTo start a program\nwith administrative rights with the Runas.exe command-line utility, open\na command prompt and start Runas.exe with this syntax:\nrunas /u:username program\nFor example, to run Process Monitor (Procmon.exe) with the local Administrator account, run the following command:\nrunas /u:administrator procmon.exe\nAfter you press Enter,\nRunas.exe prompts you for the account’s password. You must type the\npassword at the prompt; Runas.exe does not accept a password on the\ncommand line nor piped to it from the standard input stream. You can use\nthe /savecred command-line option to save the account’s password the first time you enter it; subsequent use of /savecred\nwith the same account will retrieve the saved password so that you\ndon’t have to enter it again. While this behavior is convenient, note\nthat the standard user under whose account the administrator’s password\nis saved can now use Runas.exe to launch any program without having to supply the password.\nTo use smartcard authentication instead of password authentication, add the /smartcard option to the command line. You will be prompted for a smartcard PIN instead of a password.\nmore information and tips about using RunAs, see Aaron Margosis’ “RunAs\nbasic (and intermediate) topics” blog post at the following URL:\nIf you need the\nSysinternals utility to run with full administrative rights but under\nyour nonadministrator account (for example, so that it can authenticate\nto domain resources), you can use Aaron Margosis’ MakeMeAdmin script. It\ninvokes Runas.exe twice to launch a command prompt that runs under your\ncurrent account but with full administrative rights. (Note that you\nmust have credentials for an administrative account to make this work.)\nFor more information, see his “MakeMeAdmin — temporary admin for your\nLimited User account” blog post at the following URL:\n2. Running a Program with Administrative Rights on Windows Vista or Newer\nWindows Vista and\nUAC changed everything when it came to running programs with\nadministrative rights. Running as a standard user is now the default\nstate for users’ programs, even when run by a member of the\nIf you log on to a computer\nrunning Windows Vista or newer with an account that is a member of\nAdministrators (the first account is the only one that defaults to\nAdministrators group membership on computers not joined to a domain) or\nanother powerful group such as Backup Operators or that has been granted\n“admin-equivalent” privileges, the Local Security Authority (LSA)\ncreates two logon sessions for the user, with a distinct access token\nfor each. One of these tokens represents the user’s full rights, with all groups and privileges intact. The other is a filtered\ntoken that is roughly equivalent to one belonging to a standard user,\nwith powerful groups disabled and powerful privileges removed. This\nfiltered token is used to create the user’s initial processes, such as\nUserinit.exe and Explorer.exe, and is inherited by their child\nprocesses. Starting a process with the user’s full token requires UAC\nelevation, mediated by the Application Information (Appinfo) service.\nThe Runas.exe command is still present, but it does not invoke the\nAppinfo service—so its effect is not quite the same as it was on Windows\nXP. If you start a program with Runas.exe and specify an administrative\naccount, the target program runs under the “standard user” version of\nUAC elevation can be triggered for a new process in one of several ways:\nThe program file\ncontains a manifest that indicates that it requires elevation.\nSysinternals GUI utilities such as Disk2Vhd and RAMMap that always\nrequire elevation contain such manifests.\nuser explicitly requests that the program run elevated—for example, by\nright-clicking it and choosing Run As Administrator from the context\nheuristically determines that the application is a legacy installation\nprogram. (Installer detection is enabled by default, but it can be\nturned off through a security policy.)\nThe application is associated with a compatibility mode or shim that requires elevation.\nIf the parent process is\nalready running with an administrative token, the child process simply\ninherits that token and the UAC elevation sequence is not needed. By\nconvention, console utilities that require administrative rights (for\nexample, Sysinternals LogonSessions) do not request UAC elevation.\nInstead, you should start them from an elevated command prompt or\nWindows PowerShell console.\nOnce triggered, UAC elevation can be accomplished in three ways:\nThe elevation occurs without end-user interaction. This option is\navailable only if the user is a member of the Administrators group. By\ndefault in Windows 7, silent elevation is enabled for certain Windows\ncommands. Silent elevation can be enabled for all elevation requests\nthrough security policy.\nPrompt For Consent The user is prompted whether to permit the elevation to occur with a Yes/No dialog box. (See Figure 2.)\nThis option is available only if the user is a member of the\nAdministrators group and is the default (for elevations other than the\ndefault silent elevations of Windows 7).\nPrompt For Credentials The user is prompted to provide credentials for an administrative account. (See Figure 3.)\nThis is the default for nonadministrative accounts and is the only way\nthat UAC elevation can be achieved by a nonadministrative user. You can\nalso configure this option for administrative users with a security\nNote that UAC elevations can\nbe disabled for standard users via security policy. When the policy is\nconfigured, users get an error message whenever an elevation is\nFigure 2. Windows 7 elevation prompt for consent.\nFigure 3. Windows 7 elevation prompt for credentials.\nUser Account Control is disabled, Windows reverts to a mode similar to\nthat of Windows XP. In that case, the LSA does not create filtered\ntokens, and programs run by members of the Administrators group always\nrun with administrative rights. Further, elevation prompts do not\ndisplay, but Runas.exe can be used to start a program with\nadministrative rights. Note that disabling UAC also disables Internet\nExplorer’s Protected Mode, so Internet Explorer runs with the full\nrights of the logged-on user. Disabling UAC also turns off its file and\nregistry virtualization, a feature that enables many applications that\nrequired administrative rights on Windows XP to work with standard user", "label": 1}
{"text": "A surprising 51 percent of traffic to an average Web site -- one with 50,000 to 100,000 monthly visitors -- is potentially bot generated, according to new research from Web security and performance company Incapsula.\nOn top of that, 31 percent of overall traffic to these such sites is malicious.\nThe news is worse for very small sites -- or those with fewer than 2,500 monthly visitors. Incapsula examined more than a thousand small sites and found that 83 percent of each site's traffic comes from non-human (bad bots and good bots) with bad bots accounting for 49 percent of traffic.\nSo what is the overhead represented by this automated bot traffic? Malicious bots will try to steal data, of course. But that's only some of the harm they pose to your Web site. Hosting providers are realizing that there is increased capacity overhead for each site deployed on any server because bots waste capacity, bandwidth, and power.\nMost this automated traffic is fixed, completely unrelated to the Web site's genuine human traffic volume. In other words, each Web site spun up by a hosting provider will automatically get a set level of bot traffic no matter how many real visitors it attracts. As a result, the lower any Web site's genuine human traffic, the higher the Web site's bot traffic percentage is going to be. This rule is similar to a phenomenon seen in aerodynamics known as parasitic drag. This parasitic drag occurs when moving a solid object through a gaseous medium -- for example, an airplane wing's drag during flight.\nWeb hosting companies tend to offer small site owners shared hosting with unlimited bandwidth plans. Any small Web site owner can quickly set up a site at a fixed cost and not be charged according to their storage, bandwidth, or CPU consumption. This is financially possible for the hosting provider because they can cram hundreds of sites onto a single server and enjoy the economies of scale.\nThe paradox created is that the more Web sites the hosting provider adds to the server -- in an attempt to increase overall utilization and drive more revenue -- the more the server's utilization decreases due to the increase in bot traffic, or parasitic drag.\nIn aerodynamics, drag is determined by fancy equations that show how drag changes dynamically with speed. Not so when it comes to automated traffic. In this case, the drag is linear and proportionate to the number of sites on the server. Ironically, the drag may not be apparent to Web site owners who believe they have unlimited capacity.\nAdditional points from Incapsula's research:\n- Shared hosting providers can lose over 50 percent of their server capacity.\n- Small Web site owners' page load times are increased by more than 50 percent.\n- 25 to 50 percent of Web site visitors abandon a site when load times exceed 4 seconds.\n- SEO ranking are affected (Although impossible to quantify, parasitic drag will impact SEO rankings.)\nThe security community talks a lot about the cost of a data breach but this typically assumes that hackers only incur a cost when they're successful. This assumption misses much of the real damage and cost. In reality, nearly all Web sites -- large and small -- need to sustain about 30 percent more traffic from visitors who will never click the buy button.\nThis parasitic drag incurs a tangible cost in utilization and even an intangible cost when it comes to customer experience. Imagine, for example, the impact of removing 30 percent of cars on a heavily trafficked road. The commute becomes a lot more enjoyable.", "label": 1}
{"text": "How can I tell if my computer has a virus?\nIf you can answer \"yes\" to any of the following questions, your computer might have a virus.\nIs your computer running very slowly? A common symptom of a virus is much slower than normal computer performance. However, there can be other reasons for slow performance, including a hard disk that needs defragmenting, a computer that needs more memory (RAM), or the existence of spyware or adware. For more information about spyware, see How to tell if your computer is infected with spyware.\nAre you getting unexpected messages, or are programs starting automatically? Some viruses can cause damage to Windows or some of your programs. The results of this damage might include messages appearing unexpectedly, programs starting or closing automatically, or Windows shutting down suddenly.\nIs your modem or hard disk working overtime? An e‑mail virus works by sending many copies of itself by e‑mail. One indicator of this is that the activity light on your broadband or external modem is constantly lit; another is the sound of your computer's hard disk continually working.\nThese are not always symptoms of a computer virus, but when combined with other problems, can indicate a virus infection.\nTo check for viruses, scan your computer with an antivirus program. New viruses appear every day, so keeping your antivirus program updated is important. For more information about computer security, go to the Security at Home page on the Microsoft website.

{"text": "How do I avoid getting spammed?\n1. Prevention: Prevention is the best medicine so avoid giving your email address to unfamiliar recipients. Use more than one email address; one for friends, family and colleagues and second for unfamiliar sources. If you have an e-mail address that receives a large amount of spam replace it with a new address. Once your e-mail address is on a spammer's mailing lists, it is likely that you will receive increasing amounts of spam. At work, use your work email address only for work communication.\n2. Use Filters: A second way to stop spam is to use your email application's filtering features. Most email applications allow you to block specific messages. When an offending email comes in, set the filter to block further incoming mails from that sender. At the network level, implementing spam and virus checking isn't very difficult. Depending on the mail server, implementing spam filtering such that it is able to reject spam before the SMTP session is over can be difficult.\n3. Report Spammers: A more aggressive approach to ridding unwanted email is to report the e-mailer to the spammer's ISP. This is not always an easy task. First you must determine the spam's origins. Many of the bigger and more commercial ISPs forbid spammers from using their services and, once discovered, will actively ban the offending parties from using their services. To find the spam's origins, instruct your email program to display all of the email header information. View the \"Received\" lines, and working from top to bottom you can often pinpoint the origin of spam.\nFeatured Partners Sponsored\n- Increase worker productivity, enhance data security, and enjoy greater energy savings.

{"text": "A processor, or Central Processing Unit, is one of those things most people take for granted. When you first got your computer, it may have been perfect for your needs. Everything worked the way it was supposed to work. Your pages loaded quickly, applications opened and closed quickly, and you were able to download files without any trouble. Then, there comes a time when your computer isn’t processing information as quickly as it once did. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s time to pop for a new PC or laptop. In fact, your CPU may just need a tune-up. Here are some easy tricks to help speed up your processor and end your frustration:\nUse Free File Cleaning Programs\nThe first step in boosting the power of your process is to get rid of files and other cyber clutter that you don’t need. One such program is CCleaner. The free program removes files you don’t need to allow your computer more time for other tasks that may be more demanding. There are many other free programs like this one that you can find online. Programs like CCleaner ask you to specify which types of files that can be deleted and you do get to confirm that you want to delete files before they’re removed.\nRemove Malicious Software\nAgain, there are plenty of free programs such as Malwarebytes that can be easily downloaded. Such programs usually start with a search and find all the “bad” things on your computer and present the results as a list. You are then given a few options of how to handle those items that are questionable.\nPrograms like Avast Free Antivirus detect and remove harmful viruses that are slowing down your processor. You want to look for a program that updates its virus definitions to ward off new attacks and variations of previous viruses that may have attacked your computer. Before removing the viruses, you usually get a list of the viruses that infected your computer. This is helpful in letting you know what type of attacks to look out for in the future.\nRemove Programs You’re No Longer Using\nRun a list of all programs your computer is running. Some programs automatically start running from the moment you turn on your computer, including programs you may have previously downloaded, but no longer use on a regular basis. Make sure you properly delete all unused programs. Deleting the icon from the desktop doesn’t do anything. You should notice a change in speed the next time you turn your computer on.\nEmpty Your Recycle Bin\nJust because you send something to the recycle bin, doesn’t mean that it’s gone. Think of as the difference between putting something in a trash can and physically taking it to the curb on trash day. If you have a lot of items stored in your recycle bin, emptying it could give your CPU a noticeable boost.\nTurn Off Indexing and Check Your Bookmarks\nMost servers automatically index the sites you visit. This feature can actually take up much-needed space over time. There’s really no need to index sites you either rarely visit or only visited once. As long as we’re on the subject, see what sites you have bookmarked. Odds are that there are some sites you don’t visit anymore or links that are no longer valid.\nCheck for Spyware\nOne of the top reasons for a slow CPU is due to the presence of spyware. Even some “trusted” websites may be carriers for spyware. Free programs to find, remove, and prevent spyware installation include Ad-Aware, Giant Antispyware, and SUPERAntiSpyware.\nDelete Browsing History, Cookies, and Temporary Files\nWhile it may not seem like a big deal, your browsing history can take up space. This is especially true if you haven’t reinstalled Windows recently. The same goes for cookies and temporary files. The more “clutter” you can get rid of, the faster your CPU will be.\nTransfer Your Stored Documents\nIf there are documents you want to keep, don’t leave them all on your hard drive. Consider creating a separate partition for your documents or use an external hard drive. If you do opt for an external drive, make sure you change your defaults so downloaded files save to this drive and not your hard drive.\nJust like you may not relish the task of cleaning your room, there comes a time when it’s necessary to remove clutter. The same is true with your CPU. Taking a good hour or so to remove old files, delete temporary files and cookies, and install updated antivirus protection can save you time and endless hours of frustration when things move slower than they should. You have to put some effort into any relationship, including the one you share with your CPU.\nKathleen Martins is a blogger for TorchBrowser, learn how to download torrent files with TorchBrowser.com here.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Overview of Cryptographic Techniques\nIntroduced in Chapter 1 (Cloud Computing and Security: An Introduction), cryptography is a complex and esoteric field. In modern times, cryptography has expanded from protecting the confidentiality of private communications to including techniques for assuring content integrity, identity authentication, and digital signatures along with a range of secure computing techniques. Given that range of functional utility, cryptography has been recognized as being a critical enabling technology for security in cloud computing. Focusing on data security, cryptography has great value for cloud computing.\nTo effect cryptographic data confidentiality, plaintext is converted into cyphertext by numerous means, but the ones of practical value are all based on mathematical functions that must meet several requirements, including:\n- The algorithm and implementation must be computationally efficient in converting plaintext to cyphertext, as well as in decryption.\n- The algorithm must be open to broad analysis by a community of cryptographers and others.\n- The resulting output must withstand the use of brute force attacks even by vast numbers of computers (such as in a computing grid or cloud).\nIn operation, plaintext is encrypted into cyphertext using an encryption key, and the resulting cyphertext is later decrypted using a decryption key. In Symmetric cryptography, these keys are the same (Figure 5.3).\nFIGURE 5.3 Symmetric encryption.\nSymmetric cryptography has broad applicability, but when it is used in communication between parties, the complexity of key management can become untenable since each pair of communicators should share a unique secret key. It is also very difficult to establish a secret key between communicating parties when a secure channel does not already exist for them to securely exchange a shared secret key.\nBy contrast, with asymmetric cryptography (also known as in public–private key cryptography), the encrypt key (public key) is different but mathematically related to the decrypt or private key (Figure 5.4).\nFIGURE 5.4 Asymmetric encryption.\nThe primary advantage of asymmetric cryptography is that only the private key must be kept secret—the public key can be published and need not be secret. Although public–private key pairs are related, it is infeasible to computationally derive a private key from a public key.\nThis use of public–private keys is a great enabler for confidentiality in cloud computing, and not just for encryption of content. A private key can be used to authenticate a user or computational component, and it can also be used to initiate the negotiation of a secure channel or connection between communicating parties.\nGoing one level deeper in our background treatment of cryptography, for the purpose of this book, there are four basic uses of cryptography:\n- Block Ciphers These take as input a key along with a block of plaintext and output a block of cyphertext. Because messages are generally larger than a defined block, this method requires some method to associate or knit together successive cyphertext blocks.\n- Stream Ciphers These operate against an arbitrarily long stream of input data, which is converted to an equivalent output stream of cyphertext.\n- Cryptographic Hash Functions Hash functions take an arbitrarily long input message and output a short, fixed length hash. A hash can serve various purposes, including as a digital signature or as a means to verify the integrity of the message.\n- Authentication Cryptography is also widely used within authentication and identity management systems.\nAlthough cryptography is a cornerstone of security, many an adopter has insecurely used it or worse attempted to implement cryptography to either save money or cut corners. The field of cryptography is well beyond the scope of this book, so the reader is encouraged to refer to widely available texts on cryptography in order to develop a better understanding of cryptography, its implementation, and secure application.\nSometimes you need to transfer files via secure physical media. When you do so, it is best to have the data secured on the media. To do this, you would typically create an encrypted image first and then copy it to the physical transfer media. However, you can also use encrypting media such as hardware encrypting USB flash drives. Two of the hallmarks of such devices are automated and integral encryption/decryption and hardware-based tamper resistance. They are very good as a backup for personal or sensitive data that you do not want to include in an unencrypted full disk backup. But these devices are excellent for transferring sensitive data in a highly protected manner when the transfer has to be physical.\nSince technology changes rapidly and vendors come and go, search for tamper resistant encrypting USB drive. Some of these products use very strong cryptography, and some have additional features.", "label": 1}
{"text": "While the security industry is predicted to focus on \"strike back\" measures, WatchGuard predicts these actions will be ineffective and ultimately unviable for most organizations.\nWatchGuard's 2013 security predictions include:\nA cyber attack results in a human death\nWatchGuard hopes it is wrong in this prediction. But with more computing devices embedded in cars, phones, TVs and even medical devices, digitally dealt death is not only possible, it's plausible. Security is still often an afterthought when developing innovative technical systems.\nCriminals, hacktivists, and even nation-states are launching increasingly targeted cyber-attacks, resulting in the destruction of physical equipment. Most recently, a researcher even showed how to wirelessly deliver an 830 volt shock to an insecure pacemaker, proving that digital attacks can have a real-world impact.\nMalware enters the matrix through a virtual door\nLast year was the first real-world instance of malware that sought out virtual machines (VMs) and infected them directly. Today, there is an emergence of malicious code that can recognize when it's running in a virtual system and can act accordingly.\nIn 2013, WatchGuard predicts attackers will create even more VM-targeted malware. It will be designed to take advantage of weaknesses found in many virtual environments, while attempting to avoid virtualized automatic threat detection systems.\nIt's your browser - not your system - that malware is after\nWatchGuard anticipates a steep rise in browser-infecting malware in 2013. With increased adoption of cloud services like online banking, a great deal of personal and sensitive data passes through web browsers. Many antivirus solutions are focused on catching traditional malware which infects an operating system and aren't as effective at detecting browser-based infections. Now, a new type of malware has emerged.\nStrike back gets a lot of lip service, but does little good\n\"Strike back,\" which refers to launching a counter-offensive against cyber hackers will receive a lot of attention but won't be implemented in most organizations according to WatchGuard. \"Strike backs\" can include filing lawsuits, launching cyber espionage campaigns, or even launching counter cyber-attacks against attackers.\nWatchGuard anticipates most organizations won't implement these measures given the jurisdictional challenges of digital attacks which bounce through several countries. Plus, criminals have the ability to plant \"false flags\" in malware, tricking victims and authorities into thinking someone else is behind the attack.\nWe'll pay for our lack of IPv6 expertise\nNext year, WatchGuard expects to see an increase in IPv6-based attacks and IPv6 attack tools. While the IT industry continues to be slow at adopting IPv6 into their networks, most new devices ship IPv6-aware and can create IPv6 networks on their own.\nMany IT professionals don't have a deep understanding of IPv6's technicalities, yet they have IPv6 traffic and devices on their networks. This also means most administrators haven't implemented any IPv6 security controls, opening the door to attackers looking to exploit unprotected weaknesses.\nAndroid pick pockets try to empty mobile wallets\nBased on the following three factors, WatchGuard expects to see at least one vulnerability, even if just a proof-of-concept, that allows attackers to steal money from Android devices.\n1. Mobile malware is skyrocketing.\n2. Cyber criminals are targeting Android devices more than any other because of the platform's openness.\n3. People are increasingly using mobile devices for online payments. Plus, many vendors, including Google, are starting to launch Mobile Wallets, which attaches credit cards to mobile devices.\nAn exploit sold on the \"vulnerability market\" becomes the next APT\nWatchGuard expects that at least one auctioned-off zero day exploit will emerge as a major targeted attack this year. Vulnerability markets or auctions are a new trend in information security, allowing so-called \"security\" companies to sell zero day software vulnerabilities to the highest bidder.\nWhile they claim to \"vet\" their customers and only sell to NATO governments and legitimate companies, there are few safeguards in place to prevent nefarious entities to take advantage.\nImportant cyber security-related legislation finally becomes law\nIn 2013, expect the U.S. government to pass at least one new cyber security act, which will likely impact private organizations. The U.S. government has been trying to pass cyber security bills that give the president and various government agencies some control over what happens in the event of cyber-attack on U.S. infrastructure.\nThe government also wants more cooperation among private infrastructure organizations and U.S. intelligence agencies. Many are pressing for the government to enact more detailed cyber crimes laws, which may help prosecute digital crimes. On top of that, some organizations are lobbying for tougher digital IP enforcement, which privacy advocates often oppose. While 2012 proved to be a difficult year for passing new cyber legislation, WatchGuard expects this year to be different.\nBy subscribing to our early morning news update, you will receive a daily digest of the latest security news published on Help Net Security.\nWith over 500 issues so far, reading our newsletter every Monday morning will keep you up-to-date with security risks out there.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Digital Citizenship | Feature\nExperts say that schools need to stop worrying about external internet predators and take on the threat within: cyberbullying\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, as schools first started getting widespread access to the internet, many administrators saw the potential in this new technology, but also huge risks and liabilities. While billions were being spent on hardware and connectivity, the mainstream media was fueling parental fears with stories of online predators waiting at every exit of the new information superhighway. The response from many schools was initially to teach internet safety in terms of protection from the two P's: predators and pornography. With funding coming from the Department of Justice, teacher training was conducted by law enforcement personnel and student assemblies often included uniformed police officers. At the same time, numerous well-meaning nonprofits appeared, seeking to help educators communicate with parents and students, but still through a lens of fear and protection.\nMany experts now believe this was very much the wrong approach. \"We missed the boat by concentrating on internet predators,\" says Patti Agatston, a nationally recognized counselor and cofounder of Cyberbullyhelp.com. Larry Magid, codirector of ConnectSafely.org, concurs that \"predation is statistically so unlikely that it's not where we should be putting our resources.\"\nThe focus today, Agatston and Magid agree, should be on empowering kids to be good digital citizens. Groups such as Common Sense Media have in recent years helped to reframe their discussion in terms of the skills students need to live successful, technology-rich 21st century lives. Acquiring these proficiencies requires a positive and more holistic approach: how to protect personal information, interact in social forums, deal with cyberbullying, and critically judge online information are all among these vital skills. By focusing on how schools do want kids to behave online rather than on how we don't want them to behave, \"We let them assume responsibility for their own learning and their own online experience,\" says Linda Burch, Common Sense Media's chief education and strategy officer.\nElevating the Issue\nCommon Sense Media, along with groups such as Media Awareness Network, BrainPop, Learning.com, and Web Wise Kids, all offer a breadth of resources to address these issues. While these organizations strongly encourage administrators to institute the full range of digital literacy curricula, the combination of students with smartphones, the expanded usage of social networking sites, and high-profile media coverage of recent cyberbullying tragedies has elevated the issue of cyberbullying to the top of many administrators' worry lists.\n\"Bullying and cyberbullying have a lot in common, but in many ways, cyberbullying is even more pernicious,\" says Anne Schreiber, vice president of education content at Common Sense Media. Schreiber points out that the cyberbully doesn't see his or her victim, which makes it easier to have less empathy than in a face-to-face interaction. What's more, anything written in a text or online chat or on a social networking site can be forwarded to any number of people with just a few clicks, escalating the problem beyond, say, a corner of the school cafeteria.\nSchreiber recounts a recent cyberbullying incident that began with a series of hostile text messages at school in the morning. By the afternoon, a fight had broken out between friends of the bully and friends of the victim--the harsh words were forwarded over and over until the whole school was involved. \"Because the bullying spread so quickly through viral texting, there was no time for the individuals to cool off and think about how to behave rationally or ethically,\" Schreiber notes.\nAdministrators can't shrug off issues of cyberbullying by arguing that the bulk of the issues happen with kids outside of school or that they simply don't have time in the school day. Agatston, who is the coauthor of Cyber Bullying: Bullying in the Digital Age, says that although she appreciates that school leaders are pressed for time to confront these issues, \"if they can see the link between academic achievement and bullying, they'll see that it's well worth the time.\" Agatston's research suggests that addressing cyberbullying in school improves attendance as well as students' focus on their schoolwork.\nWhat's needed, ConnectSafely's Magid contends, \"is a sustained campaign where bullying is as 'out' as racism or smoking.\" To accomplish this, experts suggest a unified and comprehensive approach, which requires that schools integrate cyberbullying education into their curriculum and adequately provide for teacher training.\nAgatston says that schools must cast a broad net in terms of who they involve in the discussion of safe online usage. \"Within schools we need to move from the idea of anti-bullying being the responsibility of the school counselor to being the responsibility of the whole school community, which includes parents,\" she says.\nStaff Training Is Key\nIf school leaders are going to engage more members of the school community, recent data suggests that much work still needs to be done with classroom teachers. According to a 2010 survey from the National Cyber Security Alliance, just 50 percent of teachers who participated in the study felt prepared to discuss cyberbullying. Over three quarters of teachers surveyed spent less than six hours on any type of professional development education related to cyberethics, cybersafety, and cybersecurity within the last 12 months.\nMany states around the country, including Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island, as well as districts such as Kentucky's Pike County Schools, have demonstrated that programs that educate their schools and, in some cases, their entire communities about the responsible use of technology can be effective. In Pike County, for example, the district was struggling in 2007 with extensive violations of its Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). After it implemented on-site professional development to support digital citizenship, the impact has been substantial. Since 2009, only two AUP violations have been recorded.\nBurch says she's optimistic about schools' abilities to substantially curb issues of cyberbullying, pointing out that more than 12,000 schools have already registered to use Common Sense Media's curriculum. Burch also sees a range of positive signs that both government and media companies are also focusing on the issue. In March, the White House launched StopBullying.gov to offer resources for students, parents, and educators on how to detect, intervene in, follow up on, and prevent bullying, including cyberbullying. The site, which was launched in concert with a White House Conference on Bullying Prevention, serves to shine a national spotlight on the issue.\nOn the media side, MTV recently launched its \"A Thin Line\" online campaign, which offers a brief user quiz followed by short, engaging videos that each highlight the message that there's \"a thin line\" between what may begin as a harmless joke and something that could end up having a serious impact on the person playing the joke or another human being. Nickelodeon recently announced that it will be creating a series of public service announcements around the issue of internet safety and will embed themes of healthy technology usage into such popular shows as iCarly. Cable in the Classroom, the public service arm of the cable industry, has numerous educational resources on digital citizenship, including cyberbullying.\nFacebook also announced that it would be making changes to how users report inappropriate activity. A new feature, dubbed \"social reporting,\" will give users new options for reporting offensive photos or Wall posts. For example, kids can now notify a trusted source, such as a parent or teacher, of foul play. In addition, when users click \"Report\" on a photo, a pop-up window will appear asking if the photo is about the user. If it is, the user can select \"I don't like this photo\" or \"This photo is harassing or bullying me.\"\nBack at school, many districts are in need of expanding or revising their policies and procedures around dealing with these important 21st century issues. The best digital citizenship programs have a number of features in common, which administrators can consider as best practices. Agatston offers the following guidelines:\n- Assess cyberbullying: Effective bullying prevention programs begin with an assessment of the problem in your school or district.\n- Develop clear policies: Policies should address both on-campus and off-campus acts that have or could have a substantial disruption on student learning or safety.\n- Provide staff training: Just as staff training is needed to adequately address bullying behavior and encourage positive bystander behavior (and in a broader sense, \"citizenship\"), training on preventing and responding to cyberbullying, as well as the broader topic of encouraging positive digital citizenship, is a necessary part of any digital citizenship program.\n- Spend class time on the topic of cyberbullying and positive digital citizenship: Classroom discussions should be part of the regularly held discussions on bullying and cover such topics as defining cyberbullying; school policies and rules regarding cyberbullying; how to report cyberbullying behavior; how to best respond to cyberbullying behavior; and the bystander role as it applies to cyberbullying.\n- Teach students online \"netiquette,\" safe use of social media, and how to monitor their online reputation: These vital social skills also have an impact on job preparedness, as social technology is increasingly being incorporated into most career paths. Lessons can be infused throughout the curriculum where appropriate. Discussions can take place when using technology in the classroom as well as when addressing career and college guidance.\n- Train and utilize student mentors: Effective prevention programming includes incorporating youth leadership, particularly to address school climate issues. Making use of student leadership sends a strong message to other youth and also recognizes that the peer group often has more legitimacy than the teacher in addressing social issues.\n- Form parent/community/school partnerships: Everyone has a role to play in encouraging positive digital citizenship. Schools need to partner with parents and community organizations in making sure that there is a consistent message about the responsible and ethical use of technology.\nUltimately, school districts should work to foster a school environment where young people are free to express themselves and their identity online, but do it in a safe, thoughtful, and respectful manner. Burch says this comes by empowering students to see that \"we all have roles and responsibility to ourselves, to our friends and family, and to the community we belong to, whether that's a school or an organization or an online community.\" Burch believes that kids respond well when leaders cast an affirming and inclusive frame around the issue of digital citizenship. \"This is their world,\" she says. \"They want to make it a positive one.\"", "label": 1}
{"text": "March 06, 2013, 3:12 PM — Deutsche Telekom launched a Web portal Wednesday that provides a real-time visualization of cyberattacks detected by its network of sensors placed around the world.\nThe website is called Sicherheitstacho.eu and aims to provide a situational overview of global cyberattack activity. The attack data is collected by 97 sensors known as honeypot systems deployed by the company around the world.\nThese sensors serve as decoys for automated attacks targeting vulnerabilities in network services, websites, smartphones and other types of systems. The incidents are displayed in real time on an interactive map as they hit the sensors and a live ticker lists their type, their country of origin and the targeted services.\nDeutsche Telekom uses the information gathered from the sensors to protect its own systems and to warn customers about the prevalence of specific threats. The company shares the data with the authorities and other security vendors.\nThe new website also provides attack statistics for the past month. For example, it shows that network services like SMB (Server Message Block), NetBIOS or SSH are frequently targeted by automated attacks. Website vulnerabilities are the second-most-common target.\nAccording to the site, last month there were more than 27.3 million attack attempts against the SMB services mimicked by the sensors; 937,476 against the NetBIOS services; 687,446 on port 33434; 669,589 against SSH; and 522,671 on port 5353.\nThe top countries from where attacks originated were Russia (2.4 million attacks), Taiwan (907,102 attacks) and Germany (780,425 attacks). The United States was in sixth place with 355,341 attacks originating from IP (Internet Protocol) addresses in the country.\nThis is not the first real-time cyberattack map based on data collected by honeypots. The Honeynet Project, a nonprofit security research organization, launched a similar service in September 2012, but the organization maintains fewer sensors than Deutsche Telekom.\nThe new Sicherheitstacho.eu portal was unveiled at the Cebit trade show in Hanover, Germany. It was built by Deutsche Telekom as part of the company's partnership with the Alliance for Cyber Security, an initiative of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and the German Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (BITKOM).", "label": 1}

See you in a week!\" Or: \"What do you mean it broke production, it runs fine on my machine?\" Or: \"Why is this working on her machine and his machine, but not my machine?\"\nDevelopment environments are becoming more complex, with more moving parts and tricky dependencies. Virtualization has been a huge boon for the IT industry in saving costs, increasing flexibility and maintaining control over complex environments. Rather than focusing on virtualization on the delivery side, let's look at how you can provide that flexibility and control to developers to manage multiple development environments easily using Vagrant.\nWhat Is Vagrant?\nVagrant is an open-source (MIT) tool for building and managing virtualized development environments developed by Mitchell Hashimoto and John Bender. Vagrant manages virtual machines hosted in Oracle VirtualBox, a full x86 virtualizer that is also open source (GPLv2).\nA virtual machine is a software implementation of a computer, running a complete operating system stack on a virtualizer. It is a full implementation of a computer with a virtual disk, memory and CPU. The machine running the virtualizer is the Host system. The virtual machine running on the virtualizer is the Guest system. As far as the Guest operating system is concerned, it is running on real hardware. From the perspective of the Host, all of the Guest's resources are used by the virtualizer program. A Box, or base image, is the prepackaged virtual machine that Vagrant will manage.\nStarting in version 1.0, Vagrant provides two installation methods: packaged installers for supported platforms or a universal install with Ruby Gems. This article covers installation using Gems. This method has three parts: 1) install VirtualBox, 2) install Ruby and 3) install Vagrant itself.\nVirtualBox is available from the VirtualBox home page with builds for Windows, OS X, Linux and Solaris. Note that Oracle provides the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack on the Download site that provides additional features to the virtualizer. The Extension Pack has a separate license (Personal Use and Evaluation License) and is not needed to use Vagrant, but if the Box you are using was created using the Extension Pack, you will need to install the Extension Pack as well.\nRuby is a popular dynamically typed object-oriented scripting language. Ruby is available out of the box in OS X, and most Linux distributions also have a Ruby package available. For Windows users, the RubyInstaller Project provides an easy way to install the Ruby runtime.\nRuby libraries and applications are available in packages called RubyGems or Gems. Ruby comes with a package management tool called gem. To install Vagrant, run the gem command:\n> gem install vagrant\nVagrant is a command-line tool. Calling\nvagrant without additional\narguments will provide the list of available arguments. I'll visit most of\nthese commands within this article, but here's a quick overview:\ninit— create the base configuration file.\nup— start a new instance of the virtual machine.\nsuspend— suspend the running guest.\nhalt— stop the running guest, similar to hitting the power button on a real machine.\nresume— restart the suspended guest.\nreload— reboot the guest.\nstatus— determine the status of vagrant for the current Vagrantfile.\nprovision— run the provisioning commands.\ndestroy— remove the current instance of the guest, delete the virtual disk and associated files.\nbox— the set of commands used to add, list, remove or repackage box files.\npackage— used for the creation of new box files.\nsshto a running guest.\nThe last thing you need to do in your installation is set up a base image. A\nBox, or base image, is the prepackaged virtual machine that Vagrant will\nmanage. Use the\nbox command to add the Box to your environment.\nvagrant box add command takes two arguments, the\nname you use to refer to the Box and\nthe location of the Box:\n> vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box\nThis command adds a new Box to the system called \"lucid32\" from a remotely hosted site over HTTP. Vagrant also will allow you to install a Box from the local filesystem:\n> vagrant box add rhel5.7 rhel5.7-20120120-1223.box [vagrant] Downloading with Vagrant::Downloaders::File...

{"text": "Every summer, computer security experts get together in Las Vegas for Black Hat and DEFCON, conferences that have earned notoriety for presentations demonstrating critical security holes discovered in widely used software. But while the conferences continue to draw big crowds, regular attendees say the bugs unveiled haven’t been quite so dramatic in recent years.\nOne reason is that a freshly discovered weakness in a popular piece of software, known in the trade as a “zero-day” vulnerability because the software makers have had no time to develop a fix, can be cashed in for much more than a reputation boost and some free drinks at the bar. Information about such flaws can command prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars from defense contractors, security agencies and governments.\nThis trade in zero-day exploits is poorly documented, but it is perhaps the most visible part of a new industry that in the years to come is likely to swallow growing portions of the U.S. national defense budget, reshape international relations, and perhaps make the Web less safe for everyone.\nZero-day exploits are valuable because they can be used to sneak software onto a computer system without detection by conventional computer security measures, such as antivirus packages or firewalls. Criminals might do that to intercept credit card numbers. An intelligence agency or military force might steal diplomatic communications or even shut down a power plant.\nIt became clear that this type of assault would define a new era in warfare in 2010, when security researchers discovered a piece of malicious software, or malware, known as Stuxnet. Now widely believed to have been a project of U.S. and Israeli intelligence (U.S. officials have yet to publicly acknowledge a role but have done so anonymously to the New York Times and NPR), Stuxnet was carefully designed to infect multiple systems needed to access and control industrial equipment used in Iran’s nuclear program. The payload was clearly the work of a group with access to government-scale resources and intelligence, but it was made possible by four zero-day exploits for Windows that allowed it to silently infect target computers. That so many precious zero-days were used at once was just one of Stuxnet’s many striking features.\nSince then, more Stuxnet-like malware has been uncovered, and it’s involved even more complex techniques (see “The Antivirus Era Is Over”). It is likely that even more have been deployed but escaped public notice. Meanwhile, governments and companies in the United States and around the world have begun paying more and more for the exploits needed to make such weapons work, says Christopher Soghoian, a principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n“On the one hand the government is freaking out about cyber-security, and on the other the U.S. is participating in a global market in vulnerabilities and pushing up the prices,” says Soghoian, who says he has spoken with people involved in the trade and that prices range from the thousands to the hundreds of thousands. Even civilian law-enforcement agencies pay for zero-days, Soghoian says, in order to sneak spy software onto suspects’ computers or mobile phones.\nExploits for mobile operating systems are particularly valued, says Soghoian, because unlike desktop computers, mobile systems are rarely updated. Apple sends updates to iPhone software a few times a year, meaning that a given flaw could be exploited for a long time. Sometimes the discoverer of a zero-day vulnerability receives a monthly payment as long as a flaw remains undiscovered. “As long as Apple or Microsoft has not fixed it you get paid,” says Soghioan.\nNo law directly regulates the sale of zero-days in the United States or elsewhere, so some traders pursue it quite openly. A Bangkok, Thailand-based security researcher who goes by the name “the Grugq” has spoken to the press about negotiating deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with government buyers from the United States and western Europe. In a discussion on Twitter last month, in which he was called an “arms dealer,” he tweeted that “exploits are not weapons,” and said that “an exploit is a component of a toolchain … the team that produces & maintains the toolchain is the weapon.”\nThe Grugq contacted MIT Technology Review to state that he has made no “public statement about exploit sales since the Forbes article.”\nSome small companies are similarly up-front about their involvement in the trade. The French security company VUPEN states on its website that it “provides government-grade exploits specifically designed for the Intelligence community and national security agencies to help them achieve their offensive cyber security and lawful intercept missions.” Last year, employees of the company publicly demonstrated a zero-day flaw that compromised Google’s Chrome browser, but they turned down Google’s offer of a $60,000 reward if they would share how it worked. What happened to the exploit is unknown.\nNo U.S. government agency has gone on the record as saying that it buys zero-days. But U.S. defense agencies and companies have begun to publicly acknowledge that they intend to launch as well as defend against cyberattacks, a stance that will require new ways to penetrate enemy computers.\nGeneral Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency and commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, told a symposium in Washington last October that the United States is prepared to do more than just block computer attacks. “Part of our defense has to consider offensive measures,” he said, making him one of the most senior officials to admit that the government will make use of malware. Earlier in 2012 the U.S. Air Force invited proposals for developing “Cyberspace Warfare Attack capabilities” that could “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.” And in November, Regina Dugan, the head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, delivered another clear signal about the direction U.S. defense technology is heading. “In the coming years we will focus an increasing portion of our cyber research on the investigation of offensive capabilities to address military-specific needs,” she said, announcing that the agency expected to expand cyber-security research from 8 percent of its budget to 12 percent.\nDefense analysts say one reason for the shift is that talking about offense introduces an element of deterrence, an established strategy for nuclear and conventional conflicts. Up to now, U.S. politicians and defense chiefs have talked mostly about the country’s vulnerability to digital attacks. Last fall, for example, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned frankly that U.S. infrastructure was being targeted by overseas attackers and that a “digital Pearl Harbor” could result (see “U.S. Power Grids, Water Plants a Hacking Target”).\nMajor defense contractors are less forthcoming about their role in making software to attack enemies of the U.S. government, but they are evidently rushing to embrace the opportunity. “It’s a growing area of the defense business at the same time that the rest of the defense business is shrinking,” says Peter Singer, director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “They’ve identified two growth areas: drones and cyber.”\nLarge contractors are hiring many people with computer security skills, and some job openings make it clear there are opportunities to play more than just defense. Last year, Northrop Grumman posted ads seeking people to “plan, execute and assess an Offensive Cyberspace Operation (OCO) mission,” and many current positions at Northrop ask for “hands-on experience of offensive cyber operations.” Raytheon prefaces its ads for security-related jobs with language designed to appeal to stereotypical computer hackers: “Surfboards, pirate flags, and DEFCON black badges decorate our offices, and our Nerf collection dwarfs that of most toy stores. Our research and development projects cover the spectrum of offensive and defensive security technologies.”\nThe new focus of America’s military and defense contractors may concern some taxpayers. As more public dollars are spent researching new ways to attack computer systems, some of that money will go to people like The Grugq to discover fresh zero-day vulnerabilities. And an escalating cycle of competition between U.S and overseas government agencies and contractors could make the world more dangerous for computer users everywhere.\n“Every country makes weapons: unfortunately, cyberspace is like that too,” says Sujeet Shenoi, who leads the U.S.-government-sponsored Cyber Corps Program at the University of Tulsa. His program trains students for government jobs defending against attacks, but he fears that defense contractors, also eager to recruit these students, are pushing the idea of offense too hard. Developing powerful malware introduces the dangerous temptation to use it, says Shenoi, who fears the consequences of active strikes against infrastructure. “I think maybe the civilian courts ought to get together and bar these kinds of attacks,” he says.\nThe ease with which perpetrators of a computer attack can hide their tracks also raises the risk that such weapons will be used, Shenoi points out. Worse, even if an attack using malware is unsuccessful, there’s a strong chance that a copy will remain somewhere on the victim’s system—by accident or design—or accidentally find its way onto computer systems not targeted at all, as Stuxnet did. Some security firms have already identified criminal malware that uses methods first seen in Stuxnet (see “Stuxnet Tricks Copied by Criminals”).\n“The parallel is dropping the atomic bomb but also leaflets with the design of it,” says Singer. He estimates that around 100 countries already have cyber-war units of some kind, and around 20 have formidable capabilities: “There’s a lot of people playing this game.”\nUpdated 2.13.2013 to include a response from The Grugq.\nSmaller design teams can now prototype and deploy faster.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Patching over software problems\nJust as you would want to patch over a hole in your pants, you might find holes in your software that could be just as problematic and leave you with serious cyber security vulnerabilities. Patch those holes before something tears wide open.\nMark Trump, FoxGuard Solutions\nThe number of cyber attacks on industrial control systems has been increasing and the activity is visible on a global scale by site, manufacturer, and even by actual control system specific parameters. Many of those attacks are possible because of vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications, which need to be fixed using software patches. Having a sound patch management program in place will greatly reduce your risk and make you a hard target to a would-be attacker.\nThat sounds good, but what does it mean? What exactly is patching? According to dictionary.com, patch, in verb form means to mend, cover, or strengthen with or as if with a patch or patches. It’s also a noun, meaning a piece of material used to cover or protect a wound, an injured part, etc.\nIn the industrial world\nIn control system terminology, patching indicates the process required to address a known weakness in a platform with the ability to have patches or software fixes applied. Platforms include operator interfaces, human machine interfaces (HMIs), computers, networking devices, and associated software loaded on these platforms.\nPatches are typically electronic files with updated configuration information or executable processes that, when applied, correct a given weakness in the affected system. Patches are critical to the protection and security of a system and should be applied as soon as possible for many reasons. As stated above, patches address known weaknesses in a system. This should be disturbing to you as an industrial control system specialist as you do not want your weaknesses to be known. But the inherent nature of patching requires most software and hardware manufacturers to notify the public first, that there is a problem with their system or software and secondly, how to address or fix the weakness.\nSince the public is informed through various means of publications including Microsoft operating system updates and antivirus definition updates that immunize systems from viruses, the bad guys have a freely available method to learn of your weaknesses. Without a proven manageable process to validate and apply patches to your systems in frequent intervals, you are exposed and at risk of having your weaknesses exploited by hackers, disgruntled employees, or worse – terrorists.\nWhat is patch management?\nPatch management is a methodical process that includes documentation, validation, backup and recovery, and a step-by-step tiered approach to the application of change on your critical systems. The core of effective patch management is the actual validation of the change to ensure the updated patches or security enhancements do not disrupt the functionality of your system. Validation should be performed in a lab or non-production environment on equipment and software that is representative of your production environment. Without this validation, you may apply patches that change security parameters of your system that could stop communication between your devices.\nUpon effective validation, prior to application of patches to the actual production equipment, a sound backup and recovery or disaster recovery plan should be in place to backup your device information and configuration. As discussed, patches actually change your system or software from its original state. If the patch causes problems, you would want to restore to your previous state immediately to resume operation.\nTo apply patches to your production system, a strategy identifying the order that patches will be applied should be identified and documented to repeat as new patches are released. From your population, identify an early adopter or first unit that you can take off-line for the time it takes to apply the patch. Then monitor for a period of time before rolling patches out on the remainder of your devices. By taking this tiered approach – lab validation, early adopter, and remainder of devices – you are greatly reducing the risk of a change or patch causing disruption to your overall system. Any issues may be identified prior to the application of patches in a very controlled, documented, and repeatable manner.\nPatching your critical industrial control systems involves the collection of known fixes or patches, validation of these changes prior to application to your system, and then methodical application of patches in a controlled manner. The more frequently you repeat this process, the more up-to-date and less vulnerable your system will be to attack. FoxGuard Solutions specializes in the process of validating changes to industrial control system devices that have patching capability. We can work with your team to identify a strategy that meets your needs while making your critical system less vulnerable to attack.\nMark Trump is the security program manager for FoxGuard Solutions.\nSafety and security channel includes information on cyber security.\nCase Study Database\nGet more exposure for your case study by uploading it to the Plant Engineering case study database, where end-users can identify relevant solutions and explore what the experts are doing to effectively implement a variety of technology and productivity related projects.\nThese case studies provide examples of how knowledgeable solution providers have used technology, processes and people to create effective and successful implementations in real-world situations.

{"text": "Security researchers have uncovered some unexpected behaviors in a piece of malware called Stuxnet. The worm exploits a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in order to propagate itself over Windows networks, but it also targets embedded software developed by Siemens that runs in industrial equipment. The worm could be used to disrupt factories and other industrial environments.\nResearchers have found that the highest concentration of Stuxnet infections is located in Iran. That discovery, coupled with the very high level of sophistication exhibited by the malware, has led some researchers to speculate that it was crafted by a major government body with the aim of disabling Iran's nuclear power plant.\nReports indicate that the worm can exploit four separate zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows, giving it substantial spreading power compared to average malware. According to Symantec researcher Liam O. Murchu, who has been analyzing the worm, it relied on command and control severs located in Malaysia and Denmark. Those servers have been disabled, but the worm has a peer-to-peer update mechanism that allows the attacker to propagate changes and new control server addresses. The update feature will make it more difficult to centrally disable the malware.\nSymantec believes that Stuxnet has been under development since June 2009, but that it has been updated periodically as the developers rolled out new capabilities and exploits. One of the vulnerabilities that it exploits in order to propagate itself is a flaw in Windows that allows a specially crafted shortcut (LNK file) on a removable storage device to automatically launch arbitrary code when the device is connected to a computer. Exploiting that vulnerability makes it possible for the worm to infect USB thumb drives, for example, and then infect Windows computers where that thumb drive is subsequently used.\nIn an analysis of the worm, independent security researcher Ralph Langner contends that the design of the malware leaves no doubt that its function is sabotage and that it is a highly targeted attack developed with insider knowledge by a skilled group of attackers. Because of the manner in which it targets programmable logic controllers in industrial equipment, he says, it's unlikely that the equipment itself can be modified to deflect such an attack.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Teaching teens, tweens basic cybersafety rules\nInternet surfers should know how to protect their computers from viruses and hackers, but teens and tweens can be especially vulnerable...\nBy Julie Weed Special to The Seattle Times\n5 things parents should teachabout protecting computers\n• Use strong passwords that combine numbers, letters and symbols. Don't make passwords easy to guess and never share them.\n• Don't open attachments from people you don't know. If they're from someone you know but they look odd, don't open them.\n• Don't make an online purchase before checking out the company and asking parents.\n• Be wary of illegal and free downloadable media. They might harbor malware.\n• Keep anti-virus software up-to-date and periodically check PC for viruses.\nInternet surfers should know how to protect their computers from viruses and hackers, but teens and tweens can be especially vulnerable because they download media from so many sources, and may not be aware of the latest scams.\nYoung people who aren't vigilant might find their files corrupted, their hard drives wiped clean and the destruction spread to family and friends' computers. Their personal data can also be stolen and used for identity theft.\nParents need to be responsible for setting up firewalls and installing virus-protection software on every computer in the home, said Nancy Willard, author of \"Cyber Savvy: Embracing Digital Safety and Civility.\" But because teens' actions can significantly affect those computers, it is important to teach them basic cybersafety rules.\nTeens and tweens should be taught never to open attachments from people they don't know, because the files might contain malicious software, or malware. Malware can disrupt a computer's operation or secretly gather personal information.\nSome malware insert a virus that destroys data or software. Others install spyware, which records keystrokes in the hopes of accessing personal information and passwords. Still others take control of the PC and use its processing power remotely, sending spam from the owner's account, for example. Odd-looking messages and attachments, even from someone the user knows, should not be opened.\nFree illegal downloads of music and videos may be enticing for teens, but the media files can carry malware. Free games can also contain malware and should be downloaded only from reputable sites.\nComputer experts say that if a computer starts crashing often, slows down significantly or exhibits other unusual behavior, it may have a virus and should be checked.\nTeens also need to know about the most common kinds of online scams, said Willard.\nLegitimate companies generally no longer request personal information by email, so teens need to learn to recognize \"phishing\" messages, which pose as legitimate companies asking the user for login IDs, passwords, credit-card or bank-account numbers. Parents can point out these emails to their children when they encounter them in their own accounts.\nPop-up windows warning users of a virus that can be fixed are also usually scams. Teens should also avoid clicking \"yes\" or \"I agree\" to banner ads on unexpected pop-up windows or websites. Instead, they can press Ctrl + F4 on the keyboard to close the window on a Windows PC. They should trust their instincts when they see deals that sound too good to be true, or email congratulating them on winning a lottery they never entered, said Willard.\nTeens should learn to make strong passwords for all their online accounts, combining letters, numbers and symbols in a combination that isn't too easy to guess. If they see their email, social-media or game account has been used by someone else, they should change the password immediately (if possible) and report it to the provider. Teens should never share their passwords.\nCriminals on the Internet can compromise someone's computer without the victim finding out for months, sometimes ever. But teens, tweens and the rest of us can take steps to minimize that risk.\nJulie Weed is a free-lance writer in Seattle.

{"text": "Having just discussed replication in Linux -- what it is, how it can be used and how it's not the same as a backup -- it's time to tackle a simple example of one of the replication tools: rsync. You will be surprised how easy it is to use rsync to replicate data to a second storage pool.\nRecently we discussed the importance of data replication for situations ranging from mission critical environments to home users. Replication ensures that you have a copy of your current data on a separate storage environment (secondary system) so that if you lose the first system (primary system), you still have access to the data.\nIn general there are two types of replication: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous replication, as the name implies, means that the primary storage and secondary storage are kept exactly the same. Any data writes (or deletes) have to complete on both the primary and secondary storage pools before returning to the application allowing it to continue. This means that the data in the data pools is an exact match.\nAsynchronous replication allows any writes (or deletes) from an application to finish on the primary storage pool. Then the data is copied from the primary storage pool to the secondary storage pool, typically outside of the application I/O path. This means that there can be some data difference between the two pools at any instance in time. The amount of data difference you can tolerate is up to you (your requirements) but you can shrink that data difference to something fairly small and tolerable.\nBut one of the most important aspects of data replication that you shouldn’t forget is that data replication and data backup are not the same thing. A backup can keep prior versions of data so that you can effectively go back in time over the life of the data to get prior versions. On the other hand, replication keeps a replica (copy) of the current data. You can get the most current state of the data from a backup but it will only be as accurate as when the backup was made. Replicas are much more recent so they will, in general, capture the data changes since the last backup. The question you need to answer is when do I need replication?\nThere is no universal answer to that question. You need to examine your data requirements and determine how important having the latest copy of the data is to your mission and the importance of the accessibility of that data. During your examinations you should also weave in discussions about off-site disaster recovery for your data center (or your home system).\nIn the previous article about replication, two replication techniques for Linux were discussed – DRBD and rsync. DRBD is a kernel based replication method that automatically replicates all data from the primary storage pool to a secondary storage pool without the user or administrator having to intervene. On the the hand, rsync is a file based approach allowing you to selectively replicate directory trees so that you don’t have to replicate an entire file system. However, rsync mush be invoked manually so it’s not as automatic as DRBD increasing the possible data differences between the primary and secondary storage pools. But many times the flexibility of replicating only portions of the data to one or more secondary storage pools make it a popular choice despite the possibility of increased data differences.\nSince rsync is so flexible and is file based, in this article I want to show a simple rsync example to illustrate what it can do for data replication.\nSimple example using rsync\nI want to present a simple rsync example to illustrate the basic steps involved in getting to replicate a directory tree. One of the advantages of rsync is that you don’t have to make a copy of the entire file system – you can just make a copy of a specific directory tree and even specific file types or file names. This makes it incredibly flexible since you can now replicate directory trees to various secondary storage servers as needed and/or focus on certain types of files or directory trees.\nFor this article I will be using rsync to replicate data from my laptop to my main storage box at home. The overall concept is that I come home from being on the road, I fire up the laptop on the home network and my data gets replicated to my home server. In addition, I will only be replicating a specific directory from the laptop to the home server since that is where I keep all the data I modify while I travel.\nLet’s start by defining terms within the rsync framework. The first two systems or terms that we need to define are the rsync server and the rsync client. One would think that the traditional client/server terms would apply, but a common source of confusion in rsync is that the rsync server does not necessarily have to be the system that has the original copy of the data and the rsync client does not have to be the recipient of the data. To better understand rsync, remember that there is a distinction between roles and processes in rsync. So to make sure we understand all the terms used in this article, there are four terms we’ll be using (taken from this link).\n- Client: This is a role within rsync where the client initiates the synchronization.\n- Server: This is a role within rsync and refers to the remote process (system) that clients connect to either within a local transfer, a remote shell, or with a network socket.\n- Sender: This is a role and a process within rsync and applies to the particular rsync process that has access to the original files being synchronized. So the “sender” process reads the data and sends it to the “receiver” process.\n- Receiver: This is a role and a process within rsync and describes the receiving process that receives the updates to the data and writes it to the storage device (i.e. the secondary storage pool).\nTo be honest, things can get a little confusing between roles and processes but I like to keep things simple. So for this example where I’m replicating data from my laptop to my home server I will define the home server as the rsync server\n, and the laptop as the rsync client\nand the laptop is the rsync sender\nsince it has the original data and the home server is the rsync receiver\n. The idea is that when I plug in the laptop to my home network, my data is automatically replicated to my home server so I have a copy in case the laptop dies.\nA reasonably good tutorial to use to start learning rsync is here. It is a bit old (1999) but it has a very good overview of rsync and explains things fairly well. There are other tutorials that cover useful topics such as how to use ssh with rsync or using stunnel with rsync.\nFor the rsync command used for my simple scenario let’s start with the simple example in the “everythinglinux” tutorial. Here is the script I used to perform the rsync that is taken from the article and adapted to my situation (notice that there are few changes).\nrsync --verbose --progress --stats --compress --rsh=/usr/bin/ssh \\\n--recursive --times --perms --links --delete \\\n--exclude \"*bak\" \\", "label": 1}
{"text": "Jun 27, 2008 (08:06 PM EDT)\nTPM: A Matter Of Trust\nRead the Original Article at InformationWeek\nThe Trusted Platform Module is a hardware-based cryptographic root of trust.\nThe idea behind hardware-based trust is that trust must start somewhere. Whether it begins in a preloaded bundle of certificates from various certificate authorities (as SSL does in browsers) or from a web of trust manually established at Pretty Good Privacy key-signing parties, cryptographic algorithms are only as strong as the trust they're built on.\nIf you want a secure transaction with someone, at some point in the past you must have verified the identity, or had someone you trust verify the identity--as SSL certificate authorities claim to do. Then, trust relationships are used to securely pass that information forward to a later transaction. Assuming there aren't any bugs in the crypto itself, this chain of trust allows for convenience later on from an initial trust relationship.\nTPM gets its own internal key from the manufacturer, and the manufacturer theoretically is unable to track those keys. TPM never releases its internal key to anything outside of itself, so it becomes its own root of trust.\nOf course, bugs do crop up. The cryptographic math is fairly well-understood at this point, but implementations often leave something to be desired.\nTake, for example, the recent weakness in the Nintendo Wii's code-signing and verification mechanism, which was meant to ensure that only authorized apps would run on the game console. Implementation flaws resulted in third parties being able to bypass the protection. Datel, which makes video-game peripherals and cheat systems, released a commercial product based on the flaw. A small group of Wii hackers also had been using the flaw to explore the Wii. Nintendo has since fixed the problem.\nA Tipping Point For The Trusted Platform Module?", "label": 1}

{"text": "RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) — Experiencing nausea, headaches or other side effects from prescriptions or over-the-counter medicines?\nResearchers say tweeting about it or posting your concerns online could one day help alert drug companies and federal regulators to problems more quickly — potentially saving lives and money.\nThe project at the University of Virginia and West Virginia University, still in its infancy, capitalizes on the idea that many companies — pharmaceutical and otherwise — already use the Internet to get consumer product and service feedback.\nSifting through innumerable posts on Twitter, Facebook, online message boards and blogs, the researchers will search for early warning signs of adverse drug reactions and interactions normally reported to the Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical companies through official channels by consumers and doctors.\nPeople are increasingly turning to the Internet to find out what's ailing them, complain about their symptoms or read up on personal health issues, said Ahmed Abbasi, a professor of information technology at University of Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce in Charlottesville. He says using data from social media could help modernize drug surveillance and have major public health, safety and business impacts.\nFunded by a $130,000 grant through the National Science Foundation's Smart Health and Wellbeing program, the project builds on earlier work analyzing online posts from 2000 to early 2012 for mentions of 20 drugs. Researchers say the earlier effort detected adverse drug reactions — in some cases years earlier than current methods.\nAbbasi said their data mining of online sources was able to identify patients experiencing tendon ruptures after using the popular antibiotic Cipro at least two years before the FDA issued its most urgent \"black box\" warning for the drug and similar antibiotics in 2008.\nDespite the rigorous testing and clinical trials before new drugs are on the market, sometimes side effects don't show up until they are used by a large number of people.\nThe FDA primarily relies on physicians and patients to enter suspected adverse events into a database of voluntary reports that have nearly doubled over the last five years and totaled around 800,000 in 2010, the latest figure available from the agency. It can take multiple cases before someone at the agency detects a pattern worth investigating. Then it conducts an investigation to determine whether the drug caused the side effects.\nThe research team believes using social media would ideally help bring issues to light faster than that.\nSpeedier discovery of adverse drug reactions could have both pros and cons, according to people who keep close track of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\"The use of social media is just one way that may improve a company's ability to learn how patients are actually reacting to medicines,\" said Jeff Francer, assistant general counsel for the industry group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. \"We're always looking for better ways to ensure medicines are being used in a safe manner.\"\nWhile knowing about drug side effects sooner could help pharmaceutical companies pull a drug or make changes to stave off side-effect related lawsuits that have cost the industry billions, analyst Steve Brozak of WBB Securities noted that knowledge could make a company liable sooner too.\nSince the Internet is teeming with spam aimed at exploiting medical fears, selling unregulated remedies or promoting illegal online pharmaceutical sales, Abbasi said researchers will weed out fake medical websites with a fraudulent website detection system co-developed by members of the team. They will use other analytic tools to further filter the information. The results will be reviewed by independent pharmaceutical experts in partnership with medical professors at WVU's medical and pharmacy schools.\nDr. Jerry Avorn, an expert in pharmaceutical safety at Harvard Medical School, called the project intriguing, but added that \"... before we take that as gospel, I think we need to understand to what extent those reports might be either exaggerated or distorted.\"\nHe suggested that \"crowdsourcing\" research on something as subjective as drug effects may not yield the most reliable results.\nInstead, Avorn pointed to the FDA's Sentinel program, which, at the first hint of trouble, allows the agency to probe medical record databases covering tens of millions of patients to track the safety of drugs and medical devices once they're on the market.\nConsumers are still encouraged to report drug reactions to the FDA because its database is currently the official way of tracking those issues, said agency spokeswoman Sandy Walsh.\nThe research team hopes sharing its findings with the larger medical community through a manageable database would allow the industry and regulators to investigate adverse drug reactions sooner and help patients too, said West Virginia University computer science professor Donald Adjeroh, who is co-leading the team. \"If you get one thousand people saying the same kind of thing (about a drug), you know that there is maybe something going on somewhere.\"\nMichael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Phlashing is a permanent denial of service (DoS) attack that exploits a vulnerability in network-based firmware updates. Such an attack is currently theoretical but if carried out could render the target device inoperable.\nRich Smith, head of HP's Systems Security Lab, discovered the vulnerability and demonstrated the attack at the EUSecWest security conference in June 2008. In a real-world execution, an attacker could use remote firmware update paths in network hardware, which are often left unprotected, to deliver corrupted firmware and flash this to the device. As a result, the device would become unusable.\nThe likelihood of phlashing attacks is under some debate. Like other types of exploits, DoS has become increasingly profit-driven. Although phlashing would be cheaper to execute and more damaging than a traditional DoS attack, its potential for gain is limited because once the network hardware has been rendered useless, the victim has no incentive to pay the attacker. The attacker's only prospect for gain would be to threaten to attack and demand a payoff to refrain from doing so. However, as suggested on the Hack a Day blog, the same attack vector could be more effectively used to flash a device with malware-embedded firmware.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Forget iris and fingerprint scans -- scanning noses could be a quicker and easier way to verify a person's identity, according to scientists in the United Kingdom. Unlike other facial features used for biometrics, such as eyes or ears, noses are difficult to conceal and also aren't changed much by facial expression.\nAdrian Evans and Adrian Moorhouse, from the University of Bath Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, decided to investigate whether images of people's noses could be used to recognize individuals.\nThey used a photographic system called PhotoFace, developed by researchers at the University of the West of England in Bristol, to scan the 3D shape of volunteers' noses and analyzed them according to six main nose shapes: Roman, Greek, Nubian, Hawk, Snub and Turn-up.\nInstead of using the whole shape of the nose, the researchers used three characteristics in their analysis: the ridge profile, the nose tip, and the nasion (the section between the eyes at the top of the nose).\nThey combined the curvature of the ridge with the ratios of the tip and nasion widths and ridge length. This combined ratio was then used to distinguish between a database of 36 people.\nWhile the researchers used a relatively small sample, they found that nose scanning showed good potential for use as a biometric, with a good recognition rate and a faster rate of image processing than with conventional biometric techniques such as whole face recognition.\nEvans said: \"Noses are prominent facial features, and yet their use as a biometric has been largely unexplored. We wanted to find out how good they could be at recognizing individuals from a database...There's no one magic biometric -- irises are a powerful biometric, but can be difficult to capture accurately and can easily be obscured by eyelids or glasses. Noses, however, are much easier to photograph and are harder to conceal, so a system that recognizes noses would work better with an uncooperative subject or for covert surveillance...We've only tried this on a small sample of people, but the technique certainly shows potential, perhaps to be used in combination with other identification techniques.\"\nProfessor Melvyn Smith led the team at the University of the West of England (UWE) who developed the PhotoFace system. \"This collaborative project with Bath is very exciting work with great potential...It works by taking photos lit by a flash from several different angles so that four images are taken in very rapid succession of every point on the face, each under different controlled lighting conditions,\" Smith said.\n\"The technique is known as photometric stereo. The software then works out the color, surface orientation and depth of each point on the face by analyzing'the shading within each of the photos,\" Smith said. \"The technique is able to achieve a level of detail that is beyond current competing technologies and can be extended to a myriad of other applications, ranging from industrial surface inspection to cosmetics.\"\nThe researchers plan in the future to build up a larger database of noses to test and refine the software to see if it can pick out individuals from a larger group of people, or distinguish between relatives from the same family.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This MMWR supplement summarizes the deliberations of CDC/ATSDR scientists and managers who met in September 2009 in Atlanta as part of the 2009 Consultation on CDC/ATSDR's Vision for Public Health Surveillance in the 21st Century. The meeting was convened to reflect on domestic and global public health surveillance practice and to recommend a strategic framework to advance public health surveillance to meet continuing and new challenges. The first report is an adaptation of the keynote address for the meeting, which summarized the history of public health surveillance, the need to reassess its usefulness, the rationale for topics selected for discussion, and the charge to participants. Subsequent reports summarize the discussions of workgroups that addressed specific topics in surveillance science and practices.\nPublic health surveillance in the United States has evolved from monitoring infectious diseases to tracking the occurrence of many noninfectious conditions, such as injuries, birth defects, chronic conditions, mental illness, illicit drug use, environmental, and occupational exposures to health risks. In 2001, the intentional dissemination of Bacillus anthracis spores and subsequent cases of anthrax in the United States provided an impetus for automating surveillance to enable early detection, rapid characterization, and timely continuous monitoring of urgent public health threats.\nAs the topics of surveillance have evolved, so have the methods of surveillance, spurred by rapid advances in information technology. With the impending mass adoption of electronic health records, procedures for conducting surveillance are taking another turn, and new opportunities for strengthening surveillance capacities are emerging. Electronic health records offer an opportunity to improve links between health-care providers and public health departments, making surveillance more effective and timely, although fulfilling that promise poses substantial challenges.\nDespite these changes in scope and methods, the fundamental premise of public health surveillance remains constant. It should provide information to the public health community regarding the health of the populations served. Stewards of public health surveillance have a responsibility to ensure that the information is used to advance public health and to safeguard the confidentiality of persons who are represented in the data.\nTo begin the process of assessing the state of public health surveillance, CDC/ATSDR leadership conducted a survey of the opinions of CDC/ATSDR scientists and managers. The survey responses identified six major concerns that must be addressed by the public health community to advance public health surveillance in the 21st century:\n- Lexicon, definitions, and conceptual framework for public health surveillance;\n- Global health surveillance;\n- Roles of information sciences and technological advances in public health surveillance;\n- Public health surveillance work force of the future;\n- Accessing and using data for public health surveillance: legal, policy, ethical, regulatory, and practical concerns related to data sharing; and\n- Analytical challenges for emerging public health surveillance.\nEach CDC Center/Institute/Office (CIO) identified five public health surveillance scientists or senior scientists to participate in the meeting. Other participants included the planning committee members and invited workgroup leads, including representatives from the CDC's Surveillance Science Advisory Group (SurvSAG) — a CDC/ATSDR employee organization dedicated to advancing surveillance practice. Although representatives from organizations representing state and local health departments were invited as observers and reviewed drafts of the papers in this MMWR supplement, the meeting was intended to generate ideas from within CDC/ATSDR and to stimulate further discussion with partners. Participation in the meeting was constrained in part because it occurred during the midst of the fall 2009 upswing in cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza, and several persons from both CDC/ATSDR and health departments were unable to attend because of their involvement in the response to the pandemic. Altogether, approximately 100 surveillance specialists from across CDC/ATSDR participated in the one and a half day meeting. Participants were divided into six workgroups that were charged to describe challenges and opportunities for each of the topic areas identified above and to propose a vision for addressing those challenges and opportunities.\nThe 2009 meeting was planned and convened before the 2010 CDC/ATSDR reorganization created an office devoted to surveillance science and practice, the Public Health Surveillance Program Office, located within a new umbrella organization called the Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (OSELS). This program office has since been merged functionally with another program in OSELS focused on public health informatics to create the Public Health Surveillance and Informatics Program Office (proposed), reflecting the interdependence between surveillance and informatics. This new office provides the CDC/ATSDR nexus for addressing common concerns in surveillance and informatics. It manages three cross-cutting surveillance systems: BioSense, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Beyond these systems, the majority of CDC/ATSDR surveillance systems are managed by programs across multiple CDC/ATSDR centers and offices and one institute.\nIn addition, the program office provides the focal point at CDC/ATSDR for addressing shared concerns in informatics, including those shaping surveillance practice, most notably opportunities arising for public health from Federal investments aimed at supporting the \"meaningful use\" of electronic health records to improve health care and population health.\nThe reports in this supplement arose from the 2009 meeting deliberations. While the reports do not reflect the insight and experience gained from surveillance practice since the 2009 meeting, the issues identified by the workshop remain relevant to surveillance practice. With the publication of this supplement, CDC/ATSDR will add to conversations about the future of public health surveillance.\nUse of trade names and commercial sources is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services.\nAll MMWR HTML versions of articles are electronic conversions from typeset documents.

{"text": "Over the past decade, there has been exponential growth in the Internet and in adoption of information technology worldwide. New ideas for software, hardware and ways of interconnecting networks has led to dramatic increases in productivity, spurred globalization, and literally changed the world. But this burst of activity has also brought some challenges. One of them is security.\nWe are now all familiar with the appearance of worms and viruses which circulate on the Internet. This malware is generally illegal and can cause varying degrees of harm - from the manageable to the serious. It can also be costly to respond to and to repair.\nGlobally, everyone is focused on information security. Customers demand it and vendors are supplying it. The security area of information technology is characterized by innovation, activity and adoption. Security technology is moving from passive to active and from isolated products to intelligent networks. Everyone -- customers, consumers and vendors -- has the incentive to get secure.\nThere is also the realization that security is not just technology, but must include processes and people as well. One size does not fit all, and all three have to be applied holistically to achieve security in all environments.\nAfter 9/11, policy makers in the US and around the world have become focused on the state of the information infrastructure. Policy makers want to ensure that users of networks employ technology, process and people best practices to make networks as secure as possible. Public-private partnerships have been formed to work through voluntary, market-based approaches to security.\nIn the US, President George W. Bush created the President's Critical Infrastructure Board in response to September 11th. Since its inception, the Board has examined issues related to cybersecurity. On February 17, 2003, the White House released its Cybersecurity Plan, and the Department of Homeland Security has been working to implement the recommendations.\nAmong other issues, the Plan urges computer users to create holistic approaches to security, and properly deploy technology, processes and people. It also suggests public-private dialogue to share information, best practices and keep current on new security approaches and challenges. The plan also encourages users to plan for and practice security response and recovery.\nPublic-private partnerships have increased their work on best practices and information sharing. For example, the National Cybersecurity Partnership (NCSP) created five cross-sector working groups. It also issued reports on awareness for home and small business users, early warning systems, technical standards and common criteria, software development and corporate governance.\nDuring 2004, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) to the President issued four substantive reports containing recommendations for improving security. The reports cover the role of government, cross sector interdependencies, information sharing and analysis and a vulnerability disclosure framework.\nThe National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) published its Top 10 tips for home, small business and education users and during 2004 launched a nationwide awareness campaign to Stay Safe online.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) continues its work on voluntary best practices and guidelines, including its guide to a holistic approach to security: the NIST Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, NIST 800-37.\nThe OECD published its Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security in 2002. The Guidelines constitute a foundation for working towards a culture of security throughout societies.\nIn 2004, the European Commission (EC) created the European Information and Network Security Agency (ENISA). ENISA is a pan-European \"center of excellence\" for security. It serves as the lead organization for public-private partnerships and information sharing throughout the EU on security best practices and voluntary guidelines.\nIn Asia, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)'s E-Security Task Force created a Cybersecurity Strategy to help deployment of best practices in the APEC economies.\nIt is now recognized that most cyber incidents are crimes. Law enforcement agencies have stepped-up the prosecution of these crimes at home and, in cooperation with others, abroad. As criminals attempt to use the network for theft, fraud, misrepresentation, extortion, vandalism and other crimes, more and more countries are ensuring that just as their laws make this activity illegal in the off-line world, their laws make this activity illegal in the on-line world and the laws must be enforced.\nSignificantly, security technology continues to innovate: networks are moving from passive to active and from point-products to system-wide, end-to-end approaches to security recognition, containment and quarantine. Further, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are competing on security and consumer ISPs have begun to offer security as part of their service.\nFrom a public policy perspective, there are things that governments can do in partnership with industry. Governments can:\nRaise awareness of the importance of getting secure\nEducate users about best practices\nEmploy best practices to secure their own systems\nFund long-term research and development; and\nEnforce aggressively the laws against cyber crime\nGovernment should not regulate security.\nRegulation will: stifle innovation; always be several steps behind; and may make us less secure.\nCompetition is driving innovation in security, and it is this innovation that will ultimately ensure the most effective security.\nLooking forward, the next area of progress can include international cooperation on the socialization of best practices and a focus on the international prosecution of cybercrime.\nIt is critical to recognize that the threat has begun to change, from ad hoc malware to criminals, organized crime and monetizing cyber incidents.\nMany public-private partnerships from the National Cybersecurity Partnership, to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security have brought hundreds of people together to create sound best practices and are making progress in achieving even more secure networks.\nCisco President and CEO John Chambers, in his personal capacity, is Vice Chairman of the U.S. National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), which advises the President on security issues.\nCisco will continue to create innovative security products and services.\nTogether, we can continue to work with partners and governments around the world to help ensure our information infrastructure is safe, secure and robust.\nSecurity has been and continues to be a core issue for Cisco -- we continue to build security into our own networks, help our customers protect theirs, and support efforts to strengthen critical public infrastructure.\nThe market is the most powerful driver of innovation. We are focused on meeting the security demands of our customers, and market-based solutions will provide the best results for them.\nFacts are important in this discussion and Cisco has reached-out to policy makers to share its factual expertise as a \"trusted advisor,\" and will continue to do so.\nU.S. Strategy to Secure Cyberspace\nNational Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC)\nThe Business Software Alliance Cybersecurity website\nThe Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P)\nTechNet CEO Cybersecurity Resource Center\nStay Safe Online\nOECD Guidelines: Towards a Culture of Security\nAPEC eSecurity Task Group\nAs of January 2005", "label": 1}
{"text": "Applying Risk Analysis Methods to University Systems\nW R Chisnall\nThe words \"Risk Analysis\" are used today in several different contexts. In safety critical situations such as the design and operation of nuclear power plants or oil and gas rigs, risk analysis is part of the process of making the chance of a disaster as small as possible. The same thinking applies to the design of aircraft blind landing systems and modern \"fly-by-wire\" avionics. In these cases the consequences of an accident are so horrendous, and therefore costly, that the chance of one happening must be made almost vanishingly small. The problem is to build a system where components are replicated and human actions are checked so that overall the system will meet its reliability targets.\nIf, on the other hand, you are a manager on a civil engineering or software development project you will want to know how the actual cost and time to completion of your project might differ from the nominal values. Large projects are composed of hundreds or even thousands of individual jobs, each of which will have had a separate estimate made of its likely duration and cost. But as the work proceeds these individual jobs will each take more or less time and cost more or less than was originally estimated. And the separate jobs are not all independent; some cannot be started until certain others have been completed. And if other constraints such as limited access to scarce resources are taken into account it is easy to understand how project slippages can easily get out of hand. In these circumstances every project manager wants to understand how sensitive his project is to the accuracy of the original estimates and how much freedom of action he will have if things start to go wrong.\nRisk analysis in the computer security context is different again. It is accepted that, in a computer system, both equipment and staff may fail, often in ways that are difficult to predict. There may be natural disasters and there may also be deliberate attacks against the system. Countermeasures are, of course, available and the most common ones are found in most installations. But very few installations are set up to safety critical standards to ensure uninterruptable working or to be totally impregnable against hacking or denial of service attacks. Instead they tend to focus on being reasonably resistant to attacks and able to restore normal working as soon as possible after an incident. The issue, of course, is one of cost. What is spent on countermeasures should be appropriate to the risks and to the costs that might arise following any disruption to normal service.\nIn this paper I shall discuss a particular risk analysis method that I have been using and which originated in UK government circles. I shall highlight some of the areas in which its use in academia differs from how it is used in the civil service and in commerce and discuss some of the benefits that would arise if it were applied more widely across the higher education sector.\nRisk Analysis in Government\nThe UK Government operates very many commercial computer systems either directly or through its various agencies. In the mid 1980s, computer security became recognised as a subject that needed to be taken seriously, even in non-military circumstances, and there was the inevitable competition for limited funds to spend on improved countermeasures. In 1985 the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), part of the Treasury, studied existing methods of carrying out security reviews so that it could recommend one for use in government departments. None of the methods investigated met all the requirements so a new one was developed to meet the specification written for the study. This became known as CRAMM, the CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Method. Originally it was just that - a method, but soon the method was implemented as a computer program that would run on standard PCs and the package was made available to public and private organisations.\nCRAMM's aims are to:\n- Ensure that security requirements are fully analysed and documented for any type or size of IT system.\n- Avoid unnecessary expenditure on unjustified security measures which can arise through the use of subjective and pragmatic risk assessments.\n- Avoid inconsistencies associated with improvised risk assessments.\n- Involve and aid management in planning and implementing security throughout the various stages spanning the life cycle of IT systems.\n- Aid security reviewers to plan and carry out assessments in a reasonable time.\n- Reduce the need for clerical effort by implementing the method as a software tool for standard PCs.\nThese aims have, in general, been met. But CRAMM's critics said that it nevertheless betrayed its origins by being unnecessarily long winded and prone to generating lots of paper output. It was also seen as being good for large systems with lots of data and many users but unwieldy for the typical systems found in smaller companies. A further criticism was that the system was designed for government-style administrative operations and this flavoured all the interactions with the reviewer and the customer.\nMore recently, following several internal government reorganisations, the range of available risk analysis packages was reviewed. And CRAMM, in an updated form, again emerged victorious. There are now two major versions. One is for UK Government use only, including the military sector, and includes classified countermeasures in its data base. But alongside this is the commercial product, freely available to anyone wishing to buy a licence. Both products are now the responsibility of the UK Security Services - with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the relevant management staff freely available.\nThe General Method.\nComputer security is about three things:\nThat information is only disclosed to those who are authorised to receive it.\nThat information can only be modified by those authorised to do so.\nThat information and other IT resources are available to authorised users when needed.\nSecurity risk analysis and management consists of two related but separate activities.\nRisk analysis involves the identification and assessment of the levels of risks calculated from the known values of assets and the levels of threats to, and vulnerabilities of, those assets.\nRisk management involves the identification, selection and adoption of countermeasures justified by the identified risks to assets and the reduction of those risks to acceptable levels.\nThere are three principal types of asset involved in an operational IT system:\n- Physical i.e. equipment, buildings and staff\n- Software i.e. the system and application software\n- Data i.e. the information stored and processed\nValuing the physical assets is relatively easy; one simply records the replacement cost. In many cases it may not be possible to buy exact replacements for lost or destroyed items but it is usually possible to find functionally equivalent pieces of equipment - often at less than the original price. And it isn't necessary to be very precise. CRAMM reduces all items to a non-linear \"value scale\" of between 1 and 10. For example, anything valued at less than 1K UKP is valued as 1; for values between 1K UKP and 10K UKP the scale value is 2. Losses of over 30M UKP are scored as a 10.\nThis use of a scale of values is important since it allows intangible losses to be equated with those which have a simple cash cost associated with them. We shall see how this is achieved when valuing the data assets is discussed.\nBuildings and staff are listed as physical assets and one can readily see how losses in these categories can be just as serious as equipment losses. But risk assessments can easily get too big to manage and one golden rule is to define, at the beginning, the scope of an assessment; and for the purposes of this paper I shall exclude buildings and staff from the discussion.\nSimilarly, it is easy to understand the value of software to an IT system. An installation that uses standard packaged software which is properly licensed and supported is at little risk since in the worst case new copies can be obtained from the vendor. But sites using bespoke software which may be old, written in an obscure programming language and inadequately documented are clearly much more vulnerable. An example of this is the \"millennium\" problem - even COBOL has become obscure to many of today's programmers.\nTo value data assets, the method looks at the impacts of accidental or deliberate :\nThere are many possible impacts which may be relevant:\n- Political or corporate embarrassment\n- Loss of commercial confidentiality\n- Infringement of personal privacy\n- Personal safety hazard\n- Failure to meet legal obligations\n- Financial loss\n- Disruption to activities.\nThe CRAMM method leads the reviewer through all combinations of the elements from the two tables above for each data asset that has been identified.\nFor example, the total loss of a company's payroll file would cause considerable embarrassment and disruption to activities but would not cause a personal safety hazard. It is unlikely to cause a financial loss directly, although there would be considerable cost associated with the disruption to normal activities while the file was rebuilt.\nA different example, and one which actually happened, concerns the deliberate modification by a hacker of patient treatment data in a hospital system. In this case at least one patient died. There would also have been direct financial loss to meet compensation claims and extreme corporate embarrassment.\nCRAMM deals with all these circumstances by using a series of guidelines which map the scale of the impact onto the scale of 1 to 10 as used for simple asset values. One example is the \"Embarrassment Guideline\" as shown below:\nEffect Value Contained in department 1 Other departments aware 2 Public made aware 3 Complaints to Members of Parliament 5 Widespread adverse publicity 7 Calls for Minister to resign 9 Minister obliged to resign 10\nThis is one table where the civil service wording is most obvious. But substituting \"director\" for \"Member of Parliament\" and \"Managing Director\" for \"Minister\" makes it quite usable in industry and commerce. It is also clear how it could easily be made compliant with the management structures in universities and other higher education establishments.\nThe equivalent \"Personal Safety Guideline\" is shown below:\nEffect Value Minor injury to an individual 2 More serious injury to an individual 4 Injury to several people 6 Death to an individual 8 Death to several people 10\n(Cynics have pointed out that it is apparently less serious to kill someone than to call for a Minister of the Crown to resign)\nIn making an assessment of a particular data asset, it is important that the reviewer does not make his own judgements about the possible impacts. He should interview the \"data owner\" and extract the information in this way, preferably without exposing the scoring tables. In this way the assessment becomes a collaborative effort; the reviewer simply the master of the process.\nThreats and Vulnerabilities\nWhen all the data assets have been examined it is necessary to consider the Threats and Vulnerabilities. The threats considered are:\n- Natural disasters e.g. fire, flood etc\n- Deliberate threats from outsiders\n- Deliberate threats from staff\n- IT equipment failures\n- Errors by staff\nThe likelihood of a threat manifesting is assessed by reference to known conditions and recent experience. For example, computer installations in earthquake zones or in the basement of a building below the flood level of a nearby river would be considered to have a significant threat level. Computer installations in buildings which are open to the public are at risk as are installations using old equipment and with a poor staff training record.\nVulnerabilities also need to be considered, and it is frequently difficult to separate a lack of vulnerability from the application of a countermeasure. For example, a computer in a wooden building and where the management of waste paper is poor is very vulnerable to fire. Appropriate countermeasures would be the installation of fire detection and extinguishing equipment - but these would not reduce the intrinsic vulnerability. Another example, particularly relevant in universities, would be that computer installations themselves should be secured, particularly in buildings which have public access.\nAt this stage the CRAMM process has information about the physical installation and the totality of the systems that run on it and their overall sensitivities. The package goes into its \"expert system\" mode and makes reference to its data base of countermeasures to find those which are known to be effective in the circumstances that have been identified. These are listed, cross referenced against the particular threats, and presented as recommendations to management.\nFor example, base line countermeasures which are generated in almost all assessments include doing back-ups of data and using passwords. In slightly riskier situations the use machine generated passwords and the formal examination of the audit logs might be recommended. At a higher level still the installation of trusted firewalls, encrypted message transfers and the positive vetting of operations staff might be suggested.\nAs with all consultancy reports, management reserves the right to accept or reject all or part of the report. Countermeasures cost money, some a great deal of money, and management may have important knowledge that was outside CRAMM's data gathering exercise and which, in its judgement, affects CRAMM's conclusions. Or it may just decide to accept the risks.\nSo, what are the advantages of using a method such as CRAMM? Well, it injects a strong measure of objectivity into the risk analysis process. Universities are multi-faceted institutions. Gone are the days when a university had a single computer installation. There are the machines which support the business functions of a university, those which are used by researchers, often on a faculty by faculty basis, and those which have moved into the basic teaching and learning processes. Institutions are being pressed to operate more and more effectively as businesses while the sources of revenue depend increasingly on quality assessments made of the teaching and research processes - certainly in the UK. And usually the entire campus is wired into the global internet with all the additional risks that brings.\nCRAMM enables the relative risks and threats to be assessed so that countermeasures appropriate to the particular system can be selected. It can also be used to show how the risks change with time as the systems evolve. But perhaps most importantly it provides new insights for IS Directors and other university managers about the ever increasing importance of computer based systems in academic life.\nThe University of Manchester\nManchester M13 9PL\nCopyright EUNIS 1997 Y.E.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Index on Censorship has submitted our concerns about the UK government’s proposed Communications Data Bill (widely known as the “snoopers charter”). We have several concerns about the government’s proposals, as surveillance and retention of data can undoubtedly have an effect on free expression. I’ll reproduce the introduction to our submission, which outlines our concerns, here, and you can read the full submission below.\nThe Communications Data Bill as currently drafted would directly undermine both the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression by making surveillance and storage of UK citizens’ communications data the norm. These rights are enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UNDR explicitly states that: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence”.\nCollection and filtering of communications data across the whole British population would not only represent an unacceptable breach of privacy but would also undermine freedom of expression. Index on Censorship – as one of the world’s leading freedom of expression organisations – has monitored censorship and surveillance around the world for forty years. The goals of widespread monitoring, information-collection and storage, and surveillance of a whole population are aims that are normally found only in authoritarian and totalitarian states, such as Iran and China, not in democracies who are bound, through their accession to the human rights conventions mentioned above, and through their commitments to democracy and freedom, only to limit free expression where it is necessary on clear grounds of national security and public order and to impose any limits in a proportionate and limited manner.\nPopulation-wide collection and filtering of communications data is neither necessary nor proportionate. Monitoring and surveillance of this kind impacts directly and in a chilling manner on freedom of expression, inhibiting and restricting individuals in how they receive, share and impart information and encouraging self-censorship. No other democracy has gone as far as the government proposes in this bill that the UK should go. As well as representing a major undermining of privacy and freedom of expression in the UK, this bill, if it became law, would be a direct encouragement and justification for authoritarian regimes to monitor in detail their entire populations online as well as off. It would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the UK to challenge these regimes on their censorship and surveillance of their populations. It is also remarkable that, in a memorandum attached to the draft bill on the compatibility of the bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the government sees fit to focus only on the right to privacy and makes no mention of the potentially chilling and damaging impacts of the bill on freedom of expression.\nThe declared purpose of this bill is to tackle crime and to ensure national security. This type of in-depth monitoring of the entire population has at no point before been used or introduced as an appropriate crime-prevention or security-promoting tool in the UK. It would represent a reversal of the presumption of innocence and an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the British population.\nFurthermore, the fact that new technology makes such population-wide data collection, filtering and monitoring possible is not a justification for using the technology in that manner. Such data collection would represent a major step-change in the amount of information available on individual citizens and is not, as has been claimed, simply a step to ensure information already available offline is also available from online sources. The distinction between ‘subscriber’, ‘use’ and ‘traffic’ data and data content is also a misleading one. The range of data that would be collected as ‘communications data’ would enable a detailed picture of individual’s habits, activities, interests, and opinions to be built up going well beyond any population-wide accumulation of data that has happened until now in the UK.\nIf you want to add your voice, you can sign 38 Degrees petition here;\nAvaaz also has a petition here;\nAnd Open Rights Group allows you to write directly to your MP here", "label": 1}

{"text": "posted last year in Dev Platform category by Donghyun Lee\nThe internals of an RDBMS is extremely profound and sensitive. When updating a record in the table, not only the size of columns to be updated affects the performance but also the size of the record itself. Updating a variable-length column is less favorable than updating a fixed-length column in terms of performance, and when updating a variable-length column, you need to change the unfill_factor value and adjust the percentage of disk space.\nIn this article, I will explain why these details affect an UPDATE performance, and what happens inside CUBRID when an UPDATE query is executed. My story will be based on the latest version of CUBRID as of today 8.4.1.\nUPDATE in RDBMS\nLet's make an analogy between the process that implements an UPDATE query in RDBMS and the process of selling products in a shopping mall.\nAt a shopping mall the employee keep frequently bought products on the shelves and less frequently purchased products in the main storage. When customers come, they can buy the products available on shelves quickly without waiting. For products not available on the shelves, they have to wait while the shopping mall employees go and retrieve them from the storage. It is the same in RDBMS. To have fast access to the data, you need to put frequently requested data in a memory buffer. How and what products are displayed on the shelves will have a profound impact on the shopping mall's sales. Likewise, depending on which data is in the memory buffer, it will have a decisive effect on RDBMS.\nIn order to improve performance, RDBMS handles data input/output by page (the default value in CUBRID is 16KB). Operations for the memory buffer used for cache are also processed by pages.\nThere could be a shortage of space if too many products are displayed on the shelf. Suppose you want to remove slow-selling items off the shelves and display other more frequently sold products. However, the latter ones are too big to be displayed. What should you do? You will have to move products around on the shelf to allocate more space for big ones.\nWhich method should you use if you do not want to rearrange a page when the new data to be UPDATED from RDBMS is bigger than the old record?\nMaybe the employees at the shopping mall could display products on the shelf all together. It would be effective to divide areas but it is impossible in RDBMS. In RDBMS, reading and writing can occur in one record at the same time, or there could be a race in limited buffer space. Therefore, you should be able to access a record exclusively by using record locking.\nHow do we actually make this work?\nUPDATE athlete SET name = 'Cheolsu Kim' WHERE code = '10980';\nThe above SQL implementation process can be summarized in the flowchart below:\nFigure 1: Implementation process flowchart for UPDATE query.\nTo be precise, we should also express the process of SQL parsing, SQL optimization, transaction process, data locking, data correction, data storing, operation logging, and operation restoration. However, this article will focus only on what happens in memory buffer and disk while updating.\nThe first thing to be done is to find the record we need to update. If the conditions used in the corresponding query can use index, then we can use index navigation.\nIf the details of the our record are in the memory buffer, use them as they are. If the record is not found in the memory buffer, we need to read it from the disk and transfer it to the memory buffer. This process is called FIX.\nIn CUBRID, index is composed of a B+ tree (for details refer to CUBRID Query Tuning Techniques and What is Covering Index in CUBRID 8.4.0?). Generally speaking, a B+ tree stores the location (VPID) of previous and next key nodes in a non-leaf node while the disk location of the actual data which corresponds to the key is stored in a leaf node. Therefore data search process is affected by the type of a B+ tree configuration.\nFigure 2: Storage structure of a B+ tree index.\nSometimes the size of a column (like text) can be bigger than a page (16KB). In this case you need a separate storage other than the node of a B+ tree. Therefore, you might have to allocate a separate storage space except the B+ tree when searching for data.\nFurther I will explain about which index configuration is likely to cause the overflow key file or overflow OID issues when UPDATE-ing a record.\nFirst, let's look at a very large node that configures index.\nCREATE INDEX idx_history ON athlete(history); UPDATE athlete SET gold = 3 WHERE history = $history_string;\nIf history field data used by key is roughly 100KB, it will be greater than a page (16KB), a unit that stores regular data. This is called an overflow key, and you cannot save the key value to a page. In a node, you should store ID (OFID, Overflow File ID), which refers to a file that stores the key value.\nAs CUBRID manages data by page, it is burdensome if data is divided into several pages, as many memory copies (memcpy) are needed to configure a single piece of data. Hence, it is recommended to consider the size of a key so that it can be stored in one page if possible.\nNow let's look at a situation in which keys are overlapped.\nCREATE INDEX idx_gender ON athlete(gender); UPDATE FROM athlete SET gender_type = 'Male' WHERE gender = 'M'\nAssume gender column is indexed. Low-selectivity of the gender field (only two values \"M\" and \"F\", or DISTINCT(column) is low) may result in many OIDs being stored in the same node in B+ tree for the same index key. If space necessary for storing OID is bigger than a page by 1/4, it will be stored in a separate Overflow OID (OOID) page. If the number of separate overflow pages increases, it would affect the performance as there would be a burden to navigate between these additional links.\nThe following is a structure of a B+ tree in case overflow files and overflow OID pages exist.\nFigure 3: A storage structure of OFID and OOID.\nModifying the Column Value\nThis process finds the record to be updated and modifies the necessary column data of the record. The following flowchart summarizes this process:\nFigure 4: Data update flowchart.\nSince RDBMS implements read and write operations in pages, you will need to read or write more than one pages. Data stored in the memory can be read/written faster than the data stored on a disk, thus you should minimize disk I/O operations by maximizing the memory.\nTo do this, you can use a memory buffer, which is an intermediate storage space. As shown in the above Figure 4, first, check if the necessary data is in the memory buffer. If there is no data, load it to the memory buffer from the disk (DB Volume). Then update the data in the memory. When the data is updated, the data to be modified is recorded in logs, and, finally, it is recorded to the database volume (disk) at the checkpoint.\nMemory and Disk Management\nThe following figure summarizes the policy and main tasks used for memory and disk management.\nFigure 5: Work that occurs when storing updated data.\nPage Management Policy\nLRU (Least-Recently Used)\nIn order to effectively use the limited buffer size and maintain recently used data, remove the data which has not been used for a long time and free up the space. This is a memory method used by the STEAL policy.\nTasks of Buffer Administrator\nThe task acquires a latch for a buffer in competition with other transactions when reading a page from a disk using a memory buffer. Therefore, you cannot use different transactions while acquiring a latch for a buffer to be used in your transaction. If there is a corresponding page in a buffer, a page is not loaded from a disk (database volume).\nThis is a different concept from FIX in a way that the task is for a page that is no longer used in a transaction. It is not always the case that an UNFIXed page is flushed to a disk.\nIn this task you will write a DIRTY page in a buffer to a disk. As you have to write a log file (WAL - Write-Ahead Log) to a disk, just before executing the task a race can occur in which two or more files write in the same log file.\nLogging Policy to Restore Failure or Rollback\nWAL (Write-Ahead Logging)\nWrite-Ahead Logging is a policy to enable restoration upon system failure, i.e. always write UNDO/REDO logs to a disk before writing the data page. UNDO includes the data before UPDATE and REDO includes the new data after UPDATE.\nYou can use STEAL/NO STEAL, FORCE/NO FORCE policies to specify when to reflect the page stored in a memory buffer to a disk.\nWhen a transaction attempts to use a memory buffer, the STEAL policy flushes the Least Recently Used (LRU) dirty pages and frees up the memory buffer. To use the STEAL policy, you need UNDO logging in order to recover old data when you rollback a transaction.\nIn contrast, the NO STEAL policy keeps a DIRTY page in a buffer until a transaction is completed. Therefore, there should be enough buffer space to keep all pages that have been changed by all transactions in progress.\nThe FORCE policy reflects all pages updated by a transaction to a database volume when commit is called. Using the FORCE policy affects performance, as disk write has to be carried out every time a transaction commits. If a page has to be corrected 20 times by several transactions in a brief period of time, the disk also needs to be written to 20 times.\nThe NO FORCE policy does not necessarily reflect all pages renewed by a transaction during a commit process. The costs for rewriting a page could be reduced, if other transactions are renewing the same page while commit is not reflected to a database volume. However, to ensure data changes by a successfully committed transaction, REDO logging is necessary in the event of a system failure.\nThe NO STEAL and FORCE policies will be the easiest implementation, but their performance is the worst. As the STEAL and NO FORCE policies are the best, most databases including CUBRID are implemented via these policies. For this reason both UNDO logging and REDO logging are necessary, and the entire record should be logged not just the column to UPDATE. When UNDO logging, the record before the change is stored as-is and the record after the change is compressed and stored when REDO logging.\nYou must note that a big record size will affect logging, even if the size of column to UPDATE is small. If there are a lot of records that are very big and the number of columns to UPDATE frequently is small, it is preferable to gather these UPDATE-able columns and create a separate table for them. This is recommended only considering the size of logging records.\nPage Storage Structure\nNow let's learn about how a page is stored depending on the size of data to UPDATE. The following figure shows the basic structure where a page is stored in the record:\nFigure 6: Record storage structure inside a page.\nWhen a new value is entered, records are assigned from the front of a page while slots are assigned from the end of a page in the opposite direction. One record consists of a header (header), fixed-length columns (Fix Col), and variable-length columns (Var Col). The following explains each component.\n- page header: Stores the following information about total slots within a page\n- a number of slots and records\n- the size of total extra space and contiguous extra space\n- the initial offset of contiguous space\n- transaction ID\n- heap page header: Stores initial record location and schema information location.\n- record: Stores a record value.\n- slot: Stores information about record location (offset, length).\nIf there is a variable-length column in a record, the size of the record to UPDATE may be changed. If the record to UPDATE is smaller than the existing size, data can be UPDATEd in the same location. However, if the size is bigger, assign the record to UPDATE in the same page, and the existing slot indicates the record to UPDATE. If there is no space in the same page to UPDATE a new record, a separate page will be assigned as shown in the following figure, and the existing record indicates a new record.\nFigure 7: The structure of record storage when space to UPDATE in the existing page is insufficient.\nIf the size of a record to UPDATE is bigger than a page, data is divided and stored by page as shown in the following figure, and the page that stored the previous data indicates the page that stored renewed data.\nFigure 8: The structure of a record storage when the record to UPDATE is bigger than a page.\nWhen writing data in this case, data should be split into several pages, and to read, the split pages should be loaded in a series of memory, which may negatively affect the performance.\nExclusive Record Lock\nTo this point we have explored how CUBRID uses system memory and disk when UPDATE query is requested. Now I will explain how to manage records within the corresponding range when executing an UPDATE query.\nGenerally, a shared lock is used to search for a specific record to allow other transactions to see [SELECT] the same record you are currently navigating. For INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, an exclusive lock is used to block access from other transactions.\nIn the searching process using WHERE condition, however, you must use an update lock instead of shared lock when acquiring the lock for the record in the target range of UPDATE. You also need to acquire the key of the record in operation and the lock for the next key to block your operating range from other transactions.\nWe will describe why an additional update lock is necessary besides exclusive lock during UPDATE, and why key locking is needed.\nThe following explains lock acquisition/release for UPDATE execution.\n- Request UPDATE query with the WHERE condition to the database server.\n- Acquire update lock while searching for the record with the corresponding range condition.\n- In this case, acquire the key lock for the following corresponding key in the WHERE condition range.\n- While executing actual data UPDATE, convert update lock to exclusive lock.\n- Commit transactions and release all acquired locks.\nThe action of an update lock can be explained as:\nas this is the only transaction authorized to UPDATE until the UPDATE transaction is completed, other transactions cannot not UPDATE.\nAnother transaction can acquire an update lock on a transaction that has a record with shared lock. However, if a transaction has acquired update lock, another transaction cannot obtain shared lock.\nConcurrency may decrease if an exclusive lock of the record to UPDATE can be obtained immediately, and thus using shared lock seems to be a better option while searching for a target by condition. Why do we have to use an update lock instead of shared lock? The reason is to minimize deadlock. For better understanding, let's look at the following table, which has no update lock.\n|Transaction 1||shared lock1 (Record A)|\n|Transaction 2||shared lock2 (Record A)|\n|Transaction 1||exclusive lock1 (Record A);|\n|Transaction 2||exclusive lock1 (Record A);|\nThe situation above is the one in which Transactions 1 and 2 of the same Record A acquired the shared lock, and they are about to upgrade the lock to exclusive lock. However, they both are waiting for the other transaction to free shared lock; that is, they are in deadlock. What would happen if there is an update lock?\n|Transaction 1||update lock1 (Record A);|\n|Transaction 2||update lock2 (Record A);|\n|Transaction 1||exclusive lock1 (Record A);|\n|Transaction 2||update lock2 (Record A);|\nexclusive lock2 (Record A);\nTransaction 1 has acquired an update lock and Transaction 2 is in the standby mode to obtain an update lock. Transaction 1 changes the update lock to exclusive lock, UPDATEs Record A and releases the lock. Transaction 2 acquires the update lock2, which was in a standby mode, and thus it can execute UPDATE. When the update lock is introduced, you can avoid some of the deadlock effects caused by UPDATE.\nThe following deals with specific examples of the situations above. Automatic commit mode is released and isolation level is 4 (REPEATABLE READ SCHEMA, READ COMMITTED INSTANCES).\ncreate table t1(id int, num int); create unique index idx_t1_id on t1(id); insert into t1 values (10,10), (20,20), (40,40), (80, 80); commit;\n|Transaction 1||Execution (update ... where id = 40;)|\n|Transaction 2||Standby (update ... id = 40;); Standby|\n|Transaction 2||Execution (update ... where id = 40;)|\nWhen a transaction is acquiring an update lock, other transactions cannot UPDATE or DELETE the corresponding record. Therefore, if you use an update lock and access the same record above, you can avoid deadlock resulting from UPDATE. An update lock is used not only for UPDATE, but also for DELETE tasks with the WHERE condition that uses index.\nAn update lock can be obtained even when the record to UPDATE is in the shared lock with other transactions; however, two or more transactions cannot be acquired at the same time.\nFor data consistency, update lock alone is insufficient. Let's consider the following example.\n|Transaction 1||delete table where id = 1|\n|Transaction 2||insert into t1 (id) values (1)|\nThere are many models that can be used to handle the request above, and approach methods vary depending on RDBMS.\nCUBRID 2008 R4.1 places the INSERT task of Transaction 2 in a standby mode. However, Transaction 1 cannot put Transaction 2's tasks in the standby mode by using an update lock as the data of the corresponding key will be deleted from the B+tree when executing DELETE. This problem can be solved by using a key lock.\nWhen performing DML tasks, a key lock acquires lock authority of the record indicated by the next key of the record for processing. If table locking is executed without obtaining a key lock, it will deteriorate concurrency; thus, a lock to a certain area should be obtained to ensure maximum concurrency.\nTypical example of using key locks is a unique index. When performing DML tasks, you should obtain a key lock for the record indicated by the next key of the corresponding record and the target record, to ensure there are no DML tasks by other transactions within the range.\nLet's learn about the operating process of key locks with the following example: Automatic commit mode is released.\ncreate table t1 (id int, num int); create unique index idx_t1_id on t1(id); insert into t1 values (10,10), (20,20), (40,40), (80, 80); commit;\n|Transaction 1||update t1 set num=400 where id=40;|\ninsert into t1 values (30, 30); Standby… rollback;\ndelete from t1 where id=20; Standby… rollback;\ninsert into t1 value (70, 70); Standby… rollback;\ndelete from t1 where id=80; Standby… rollback;\nupdate t1 set num=444 where id=80; Standby…rollback;\n- When Transaction 1 executes UPDATE of the id=40 record, the transaction will acquire the key lock for the id=40 key and id=80, the next key. In this case, other transactions within the range cannot INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE new records.\n- For Transaction 2 to INSERT the id=30 record, it should acquire the key lock for id=40; as Transaction 1 already acquired the key lock for id=40, the work is in standby mode.\n- As Transaction 1 already acquired the key lock for id=40 and id=80, all other tasks, which require the work with these keys, are all in standby mode.\nIt is likely that other transactions can be in standby mode because of key lock. The more indexes you have on a column you plan to UPDATE, the occurrence of key lock may increase which results in a greater negative effect on UPDATE performance. Thus, we recommend that you remove index for the corresponding columns, considering both SELECT and UPDATE performance.\nFigure 9: Key lock related scenario about records being updated.\nConsidering the occurrence of deadlock between indexes due to key lock, we recommend that you retry the corresponding task. In the following scenario, we will learn about deadlocks resulting from key lock. Deadlock may occur under the assumption that Transaction 1 and 2 are implemented at the same time.\ncreate table t1(id int, num int); create unique index idx_t1_id on t1(id); insert into t1 values (10,10), (20,20), (40,40), (80, 80);commit;\n|Transaction 1||update t1 set num = 40 where id = 1 using index pk_t1_id; (pk)|\n|Transaction 2||update t1 set id = 30 where num = 7 using index i_t1_num; (idx)|\nFigure 10: Deadlock scenario caused by key lock.\nTransaction 1 attempts to UPDATE the column num of id=1 record and obtains the key lock for id=1 and id=5 as well as the exclusive lock for record (1,9). In this case, Transaction 2 attempts to UPDATE the column id, which is num = 7, and acquires the key lock for num=7 and num=9 as well as the exclusive lock for record (5 and 7).\nTransaction 1 needs the key lock for index idx 9 to UPDATE the column num of id=1 record but Transaction 2 has already acquired the corresponding lock. While Transaction 2 needs the key lock for index pk 5 to UPDATE the column id of num=9 record, Transaction 1 has already acquired the corresponding lock. That is, deadlock has occurred.\nKey lock has key shared lock and key exclusive lock. The lock that the INSERT task acquires for the next key is key shared lock, and the lock that UPDATEd or DELETEd tasks will acquire for the next key is key exclusive lock. When UPDATE or DELETE is working on the record of a specific range, other transactions must not change the record within the corresponding range; this is to allow INSERT by other transactions into the key lock range of the next location during INSERT operation. Let's examine the following figure:\nFigure 11: Key lock related scenario for record being INSERTed.\nWhen Transaction 1 INSERTs id = 90 record, it acquires the key shared lock for id = 100, the next key. When Transaction 2 INSERTs id = 95 record, it acquires the key shard lock for id = 100, which is also the next key. Lock sharing by transactions that are different from one another on the same key id = 100 is possible because key lock is acquired in key shared lock mode.\nIn this article we have observed the events that occur in the memory and disk storage structure during UPDATE of data in CUBRID and how to obtain locks so as to block other transactions from the record within the UPDATE range.\nIt is a mistake to think that the processing costs will be small if just one record or a small column is UPDATEd. When searching for the WHERE condition to find the UPDATE target, yes, the use of index will affect the searching time. But also you must remember that the size of a record also affects UNDO/REDO logging, not the size of UPDATE target column. We can assume that the smaller the size of record to be UPDATEd and the longer the fixed-length compared to the existing size, the more advantageous it is for UPDATE performance.\nUnder the assumption that UPDATE of a variable-length column occurs always, you can consider adjusting the system parameter unfill_factor (the default value 0.1) value, which controls the disk space of a pre-allocated page for data UPDATE. For example, suppose the value of unfill_factor is 0.1, there will be about 10% of extra space in a page when data INSERT occurs continuously; thus, the remained 10% of extra space could be used for INSERT for the same page or for UPDATE.\nUPDATE requires update lock and key lock. You should understand that these could lead to standby or deadlock of competing transactions. If an unexpected delay or deadlock occurs, you should check if an index configuration for UPDATE column is appropriate, or if the number of indexes on the column could be minimized.\nI hope that this article and the recommendations I gave to reduce the burden of UPDATE execution provide you an opportunity to understand the locking and storage structure usage methods in CUBRID database when executing UPDATE operations.\nBy Lee Donghyun, CUBRID Manual and Release Notes writer, CUBRID DBMS Development Lab, NHN Corporation.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Onion Routing Averts Prying EyesBy Ann Harrison\nStory location: http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,64464,00.html\n02:00 AM Aug. 05, 2004 PT\nComputer programmers are modifying a communications system, originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, to help Internet users surf the Web anonymously and shield their online activities from corporate or government eyes.\nThe system is based on a concept called onion routing. It works like this: Messages, or packets of information, are sent through a distributed network of randomly selected servers, or nodes, each of which knows only its predecessor and successor. Messages flowing through this network are unwrapped by a symmetric encryption key at each server that peels off one layer and reveals instructions for the next downstream node.\nIn contrast, messages traveling across the Internet are generally not encrypted, and the path of a message can be seen easily, linking users to activities like website visits.\nThe Navy is financing the development of a second-generation onion-routing system called Tor, which addresses many of the flaws in the original design and makes it easier to use. The Tor client behaves like a SOCKS proxy (a common protocol for developing secure communication services), allowing applications like Mozilla, SSH and FTP clients to talk directly to Tor and route data streams through a network of onion routers, without long delays.\nOnion routing does not guarantee perfect anonymity. But it helps protect users from eavesdroppers who aren't watching both the initiator and recipient of the message at the time of the transaction. Developers say Tor can be used to prevent websites from tracking their users; block governments from collecting lists of website visitors; protect whistleblowers; and circumvent local censorship by employers, ISPs or schools that restrict access to certain online services.\nThe Navy is financing Tor because it wants to hide the identity of government employees who have long used anonymous communications systems for intelligence gathering and politically sensitive negotiations.\n\"The point of the Tor system is to spread the traffic over multiple points of control so that no one person or company has the ability to link people,\" said programmer Roger Dingledine. Dingledine and Nick Mathewson, both based in Boston, are building Tor as a research platform with a worldwide community of open-source software developers.\nTheir goal is to blend together a wide range of users and avoid the weakness of many anonymizing services that are located on a handful of machines and vulnerable to a single point of failure.\nCompanies could also use Tor for discreet competitive research, said Dingledine, or to route their employees' Web browsing so employment sites like Monster can't determine which of them are trolling for a job. \"Plenty of people don't want their source IP listed in Web logs, especially .mil or .gov visitors,\" said Dingledine.\nThe security of the Tor service is proportional to the number of nodes in the system. Tor is slowly scaling and looking for tens of thousands of participants who can provide enough nodes to prevent the service from being compromised by what the project website describes as \"curious telcos and brute-force attacks.\"\n\"The current Tor version very effectively builds on 20 years of development in anonymous designs,\" said cryptographer David Chaum, whose 1981 paper on untraceable e-mail, return addresses and digital pseudonyms set the groundwork for the Tor service.\nTor is distributed as free software under the commonly used 3-clause BSD license. About 1,000 users (it's an anonymous network, so developers aren't exactly sure) are running the service in client or server mode.\nThe Tor network currently includes 35 servers that forward each data stream at least three times. Each server averages 10 Kbps of bandwidth. Those with reliable Internet connections, who can support at least 1 Mbps in both directions, are being recruited as potential servers in the network.\nUsers are permitted to operate an unrestricted number of nodes. But Dingledine pointed out that a well-funded adversary could sign up for a large number of servers and potentially take over the network.\nThose who want to operate Tor routers must therefore convince the Tor directory server operators that they are trustworthy and reliable. Dingledine said developers are trying to find ways to scale the system without having to have a human check the integrity of every new server that becomes part of the network.\nDingeldine said the developers of another online anonymity project, called JAP, were forced by the German government to insert a backdoor into the program and were barred from revealing it. If anyone insisted on similar measures for Tor, Dingledine said the community of open-source developers who analyze source-code changes for each Tor revision would expose it -- as they did with JAP.\n\"The reason Tor works is that it's free and available software,\" said Dingledine. \"If it was a closed source or a proprietary system, there is no way to know.\"", "label": 1}
{"text": "Setting up a VPN Gateway\nA virtual private network (VPN) is a tool that enables the secure transmission of data over untrusted networks such as the Internet. VPNs commonly are used to connect local area networks (LANs) into wide area networks (WANs) using the Internet. Perhaps you need to build a VPN between two offices but are not sure if the large infrastructure costs associated with an enterprise-level VPN solution are justifiable. The performance of applications that are intended for use over LANs (for example those that use network file sharing) seriously can be degraded over WAN connections. Likewise, lower bandwidth and longer latency in WAN connections can affect adversely the reliability and performance of groupware and thin-client applications. Perhaps you have a home office and would like to use your high-speed internet access to connect seamlessly and securely to your office LAN through an IPSec-capable router. Or perhaps you are just curious about VPNs and IPSec in general and want to experiment.\nThe VPN firewall discussed in this article will run on just about any 486-or-better PC that has 16MB or more main memory and two Linux-compatible Ethernet network cards. The idea is to provide a starting point from a single, self-contained package that will allow you to create robust, secure, scalable and highly configurable VPNs that also are interoperable with many common commercial VPN implementations. If you wish to experiment on a low-maintenance firewall-VPN gateway, then the package discussed here might be ideal for you.\nThis article shows you how to set up, at minimal expense, a working VPN gateway that uses the IETF's (Internet Engineering Task Force) IPSec (internet protocol security) specification. IPSec is an open standard and is supported by virtually all major firewall software and hardware vendors, such as Lucent, Cisco, Nortel and Check Point. This package will give you a widely interoperable IPSec that uses the de facto standard 3DES encrypted, MD5-authenticated site-to-site or point-to-site VPN. You should be able to do this without resorting to a full Linux distribution or recompiling a standard Linux kernel with a kernel IPSec module.\nThe VPN system we examine here is based on FreeS/WAN (www.freeswan.org), a portable, open-source implementation of the IPSec specification. FreeS/WAN has been demonstrated to interoperate, to various degrees, with Cisco IOS 12.0 and later routers, Nortel Contivity Switches, OpenBSD, Raptor Firewall, Check Point FW-1, SSH Sentinel VPN 1.1, F-Secure VPN, Xedia Access Point, PGP 6.5/PGPnet and later, IRE SafeNet/SoftPK, Freegate 1.3, Borderware 6.0, TimeStep PERMIT/Gate 2520, Intel Shiva LanRover, Sun Solaris and Windows 2000. The official FreeS/WAN web site has a regularly updated compatibility list with the latest version of its on-line documentation. FreeS/WAN version 1.5 is included in this package.\nI have created a single-diskette distribution that installs the base configuration of a VPN firewall based on the Linux Router Project (LRP, www.linuxrouter.org), a compact Linux distribution that can fit on a single, bootable floppy diskette. The distribution here is essentially Charles Steinkuehler's Eiger disk image with Steinkuehler's IPSec-enabled kernel and LRP IPSec package. Firewalling is carried out through Linux ipchains. This particular version is based on the 2.2.16 kernel of Linux. This distribution is called DUCLING (Diskette-based Ultra Compact Linux IPSec Network Gateway). Compact Linux distributions have a twisted history. LRP technically refers to Dave Cinege's compact distribution. There are many variants around, including Charles Steinkuehler's distribution (EigerStein) of Matthew Grant's defunct Eiger version (lrp1.steinkuehler.net). Another such distribution is David Douthitt's Oxygen (leaf.sourceforge.net/content.php?menu=900&page_id=1). Also, there is LEAF (Linux Embedded Appliance Firewall), a developer's umbrella that tries to coordinate releases and documentation, sort of like a one-stop shop for compact Linux distributions (leaf.sourceforge.net). I use the term LRP to refer to the compact Linux distribution presented here, even though some may consider this terminology incorrect.\nIf you are running MS Windows 9x, the distribution self-extracts and installs itself onto a standard 3.5\", high-density floppy diskette. You also can write the image to a boot floppy if you have a system running Linux. Once the extraction is done, you will need to boot off the floppy disk you have created, copy the network drivers for your network cards over and edit the appropriate configuration files. That's it—no creating and formatting disk partitions or messing with boot managers on your hard drive. If you are not happy with the distribution, just pop the diskette out, throw it away (or reformat it) and reboot your PC.

{"text": "When to trust a website\nKnowing when to trust a website depends in part on who publishes the website, what info they might want from you, and what you want from the site. If you're not sure whether to trust a website, consider these questions:\nSmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer helps protect you from phishing and malware attacks by warning you if a website or download location has been reported as unsafe.\nWindows SmartScreen checks the reputation of apps downloaded from the Internet and warns you if the app isn't well-known and might be malicious.\nIf Windows SmartScreen isn't turned on, then SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer will check the reputation of downloaded apps. If the app doesn't have established reputation, a warning dialogue is shown.\nIf you're visiting the website with a secure connection, you'll be able to identify the website through the site's certificate. A secure or encrypted website address will begin with HTTPS rather than HTTP, and you'll often see some sort of icon in the browser, such as a padlock indicating that the website is secure. Secure connections use certificates to identify the website and to encrypt your connection so that it will be more difficult for a hacker to view.\nDepending on the type of certificate the website has, you can see the website address or the company address that the certificate was issued to. Extended Validation (EV) certificates will turn the address bar green in some browsers, and will contain a confirmed name and address for the website owner. Non-EV certificates will contain the website address or the domain of the site. If you can view a security report, and it only shows the website's address, be sure it's the address you wanted to visit. Phishing or fraudulent websites will often use similar website names to trick visitors into believing they're visiting trusted sites.\nCertificates are issued by companies called certification authorities. Windows contains a list of the most common certification authorities. If Windows doesn't recognise the issuer of the certificate, a warning message will appear. However, Windows can be configured to trust any certification authority, so you should not rely solely on receiving a warning message when a website is potentially fraudulent.\nAn Internet trust organisation is a company that verifies that a website has a privacy statement (a posted notification of how your personal information is used) and that the website gives you a choice of how they use your information. Websites approved by Internet trust organisations are able to display the privacy certification seals, usually somewhere on their home page or order forms. However, these seals don't guarantee that a website is trustworthy; it just means the website complies with the terms acceptable to the Internet trust organisation. Additionally, some unscrupulous websites might display the trust logos fraudulently. If you're not sure whether a trust logo is legitimate, contact the trust organisation to see if the website is registered with them.\nTo learn more about these trust organisations, you can go to the TRUSTe website, the BBB Online website\nor the WebTrust website.\nIf you're asked for personal info, such as credit card numbers or bank information, only provide it if there's a good reason to do so. Also, make sure there's a secure entry form for recording info. Look for a message stating that the info will be encrypted and check for a lock icon or ensure that the web address starts with HTTPS:// (don't enter confidential information if neither of these are present). Also, try to find out what the website's policy is about storing info: Do they keep your credit card number on file? Do they have partners that they share info with?
